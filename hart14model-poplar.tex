%% Text of abstract
  The \acf{AHB} is a consortium of university and industry partners
  investigating the development of a sustainable hardwood biofuels
  industry in Washington, Oregon, Northern California and Northern
  Idaho in the U.S.  Inspired in part by the U.S. Energy Independence
  and Security Act 2022 targets for renewable fuel (renewable fuel
  standard), \ac{AHB} is carrying out research and development to
  support a system for growing and converting hardwoods, such as
  hybrid poplars, into liquid biofuels that are fully compatible with
  existing infrastructure.

  Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability
  of a biofuels industry based on this feedstock requires spatial
  predictions of the growth and yield of \acf{SWRC} under various
  environmental conditions and throughout the entire Pacific Northwest
  region.  The \acf{3pg} model was selected and modified for \ac{SRWC},
  particularly for poplar plantation methodologies.  This included
  developing a sub-model which takes into account the coppicing
  strategy for harvesting poplar.

  A physiological growth model such as \ac{3pg} is advantageous because it
  allows variation of growth parameters and assumptions regarding
  management practices for poplar species.  Because it is a canopy
  carbon balance model, allocations for both above and below ground
  biomass can be tracked for life-cycle analysis of the product fuels.

  The original \ac{3pg} model does not include coppicing as a management
  practice, which is problematic as it cannot reasonably account for
  post-coppicing regrowth.  The extended model includes coppicing with
  a general model that allows a monthly growth contribution from an
  existing root mass.  The model specifies a relatively small
  contribution of aboveground growth from the accumulated root mass
  after coppicing in order to initiate the next cycle of production.

  The \ac{3pg} model was validated against a number of field studies
  related to the growth of poplar as a \ac{SRWC} biofuel feedstock.  The
  parameterized model was then applied to the entire Pacific Northwest
  region, using appropriate climatological and soil input data.
  Climate data included both historical patterns as well as predicted
  patterns from simulations under various climate scenarios.  The
  result was a map of predicted yields and expected bounds on the
  variation of these yields useful for determining when it becomes
  economically feasible for poplar to be grown within the study
  area. Results were integrated with other models that allow for
  optimizing the crop selection and biorefinery site selection.
  Important findings from the model include; validation of the \ac{3pg}
  model for coppiced \ac{SRWC} plantings, estimates of biomass feedstock
  yields under different irrigation patterns and weather conditions,
  and annual estimates for feedstock availability when combined with
  crop adoption scenarios.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Using climatological and soil parameters along with the \ac{3pg} forest
growth model, yield predictions for poplar plantations can be made for
the entire Pacific Northwest.  This yield model can be overlaid with
land use patterns to predict yields for potential plantation
locations.  Yield maps are the results of running the \ac{3pg} Model for
the entire \ac{AHB} region. Weather information is derived from the PRISM
Climate Group~\cite{daly2008} and the \acf{NREL} monthly radiation
data (Marion, 1994). Soils data is derived from
\acf{STATSGO}~cite{soil-statsgo2012}.

With appropriate input information, the \ac{3pg} model can predict
yields for the entire Pacific Northwest study region, under various
irrigation scenarios.  When linked with models of crop adoption,
annual feedstock estimates are possible.

For example, a companion model, the \acf{BCAM} predicts price levels
where poplar competes with existing crops in general cropping regions.
The yield results, along with the \ac{BCAM} predictions can be used in
the \acf{GBSM} in order to optimize where in the region poplar might
be adopted.

The current model makes these estimations on an 8x8 km2 grid, a
resolution that is fairly taxing for the solver of the \ac{GBSM}
model.  Subsequent model runs at a finer scale can test the best
scales for application of these models.

\section{Methods and Calculation}

The goal of this study is to create a map of poplar growth potential
for this region that can inform our participants, and subsequent
models on the predicted yields from \ac{SRWC} plantations.

Figure~\ref{fig:grid} shows the study area, the Pacific Northwest of
the United States, incorporating Washington, Oregon, Northern
California, and Western Idaho.  This definition of the Pacific
Northwest is somewhat inclusive in the South, including the northern
part of California.

A regular grid is used to partition the region.  The initial size of
the grid is relatively coarse $8192 \times 8192$ (m x m), and designed
to reduce some of the complexity of our regional optimization models.
The projection is an Albers equal area projection with standard
longitude 120\degree West, and parallels at latitudes 41\degree and
47\degree North~\cite{Butler}. This somewhat specialized projection
insures the pixels maintain a constant area, while maintaining good
conformity for our transportation networks.  The pixel size is
$2^{13}$ (m).  This allows easy scaling up and down of the data to
different resolutions while maintaining common edges.  For example,
the \ac{NLCD} dataset, used in this study, was originally imported at
$2^5$ (m), and scaled upwards to determine percentages of landcover
for each pixel.

Data processing was carried out with a postgresql database, with the
postgis geospatial extensions~\cite{pgsql,Holl2009,postgis}.
Specialized calculations were implemented as postgresql functions, using
various scripting languages; SQL, PLSQL, Javascript, and R.

\subsection{\acs{3pg} Model Formulation}
\label{sec:3pg}

The \acf{3pg} model~\cite{Landsberg1997, landsberg2010physiological,
  Sands2004} takes as inputs weather data, and site factors, including
soil parameters, initial stocking conditions, management practices,
and species definitions.  In this study, the \ac{3pg} model is run at
a monthly timestep. At each step the physiological parameters are
calculated and carried forward to the next month.  These incremental
physiological parameters can be plotted to compare model predictions
with field results at multiple stages in the plantation’s history.
Figure~\ref{fig:overview} gives an overview of the \acf{3pg} model.

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{model_overview}
\caption{ The \ac{3pg} model's main inputs.  Running at a monthly timestep, with
appropriate input parameters, the model predicts tree growth and a
number of other parameters.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The original \ac{3pg} model allocates mass produced from transpiration
into the the creation of new roots, stems and foliage.  After
coppicing however, the model has no mechanism to increase start of
re-growth from the root.  A simple coppicing model has been developed
to add an additional production from the root system after
coppicing\cite{hart14-coppice}.  The seasonal timing of the
contribution is moderated by comparing the actual \ac{NPP} to the
\ac{NPP} the root could produce if it had a more complete canopy.
This difference serves as a target for the root contribution.  This
method times regrowth with climatic conditions that are favorable for
growth.  The monthly root contribution affects the length of time for
the contribution to be made.  In poplar plantations, the initial
planting is modeled the same way, however with different parameters to
model initial propagation methods.

\label{sec:climate}

The Pacific Northwest weather patterns are influenced primarily by the
Pacific storm track, which brings in the bulk of precipitation in the
months of October through March, and the location and size of the
mountain ranges, which moderate both the precipitation, and the
temperatures throughout the year.

In order to predict temperatures and precipitation on the near term,
the \acf{PRISM} dataset was used.  \ac{PRISM} extrapolates station
data spatially to a uniform grid using weights derived from the
physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. These
similarity measures include location, elevation, coastal proximity,
topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic
position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain.  \ac{PRISM}
data is available on a 2.5 minute geographic grid.

16 years of \ac{PRISM} data were interpolated (cubic spline) to the
\ac{AHB} grid averaged to determine a representative weather pattern
used near term modeling for the \ac{AHB} yield predictions.
Figure~\ref{fig:temp} show annual mean temperature and precipitation
variation of the region.  Isolines show the standard deviation between
annual mean temperature to the monthly mean temperature.  Similarly
isolines are shown on the precipitation map.

  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{hart14poplar-model-weather}  
  \caption{Example temperature and precipitation maps.}
  \label{fig:temp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Soil Parameters}
\label{sec:soil}

\ac{3pg} uses a single layer soil model that maintains an estimate of
the amount of water available at any timestep in the model.  In
addition, \ac{3pg} includes a growth limiter related to the available
water in the soil, and the soil type.  These require a number of soil
parameters.  \ac{maxAWS} determines the maximum holding capacity of
the soil.  The limiter \ac{fSW} is parameterized with two values,
$\ac{fSW} = \frac{1-(1-\ac{AWS}/\ac{maxAWS})^\ac{swp}
{1+((1-\ac{AWS}/\ac{maxAWS})/\ac{swc})^\ac{swp}}$, where \ac{swp}
and \ac{swc} are functions of the soil type.  

These parameters are all determined using the \ac{STATSGO} database.
\ac{STATSGO} is a national soil database, distributed by the
\ac{NRCS}.  \ac{STATSGO} maps are designed for regional studies, and
the soil inventories are typically generalized from more detailed
surveys, or from a combination of ancillary datasets.  Individual
\ac{STATSGO} areas can contain multiple soil components, and the map
units are linked to attributes the soil data base which gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and their associated
properties.  The \ac{mmu} is about 625 (ha).  For each pixel in the
modeling grid, intersecting map units are averged for the estimated
pixel values.  1887 different soil were used, contributing anywhere
from 144 to 1.3M (ha).

\ac{maxAWS} is directly taken from the \ac{STATSGO} database which
Figure~\ref{fig:aws} shows the \ac{maxAWS} estimates.

Included in the figure are the lines designating the soil polygons
used.
