  Important findings from the model include; validation of the

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%% Text of abstract
The \acf{AHB} is a consortium of university and industry partners
investigating the development of a sustainable hardwood biofuels
industry in Washington, Oregon, Northern California and Western Idaho
in the U.S.  Inspired in part by the U.S. Energy Independence and
Security Act 2022 targets for renewable fuel, \ac{AHB} is carrying out
research and development to support a system for growing and
converting hardwoods, such as hybrid poplars, into liquid biofuels
that are fully compatible with existing infrastructure.

Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability of
a biofuels industry based on poplar requires spatial predictions of
the growth and yield of \acf{SRWC} under various environmental
conditions and throughout the entire \acf{PNW} region.  The \acf{3pg}
model was selected and modified for \ac{SRWC}, particularly for poplar
plantation methodologies.  This included developing a sub-model which
takes into account the coppicing strategy for harvesting poplar.

A physiological growth model such as \ac{3pg} is advantageous because
it allows variation of growth parameters and assumptions regarding
management practices for poplar species.  In addtion to biomass growth
and yield estimations, because it is a canopy carbon balance model,
allocations for both above and below ground biomass can be tracked for
life-cycle analysis of the product fuels.

The original \ac{3pg} model does not include coppicing as a management
practice, which is problematic as it cannot reasonably account for
post-coppicing regrowth.  The extended model includes coppicing with a
general model that allows a monthly growth contribution from an
existing root mass.  The model specifies a relatively small
contribution of aboveground growth from the accumulated root mass
after coppicing in order to initiate the next cycle of production.

The \ac{3pg} model was validated against a number of field studies
related to the growth of poplar as a \ac{SRWC} biofuel feedstock.  The
parameterized model was then applied to the entire Pacific Northwest
region, using appropriate climatology and soil input data.  Climate
data included both historical patterns as well as predicted patterns
from simulations predicting climate change.  These inputs produce
Polar yield prediction maps and expected bounds on the variation of
these yields useful for determining when it becomes economically
feasible for poplar to be grown within the study area. 

This yield model is overlaid with surface and land cover
parameters to predict yields for potential plantation locations.
Yield maps are the results of running the \ac{3pg} Model for the
entire \ac{AHB} region. 

With appropriate input information, the \ac{3pg} model can predict
yields for the entire Pacific Northwest study region, under various
irrigation scenarios.  When linked with models of crop adoption,
annual feedstock estimates are possible.

\section{Methods and Calculation}

The main goal of this study was to create spatially explicit poplar
growth potential for the \ac{PNW} that can inform our participants and
subsequent modeling efforts on the predicted yields from \ac{SRWC}
plantations.

The study area, the Pacific Northwest of the United States,
incorporates Washington, Oregon, Northern California, and Western
Idaho.  This definition of the \acs{PNW} is somewhat inclusive in the
South, including the northern part of California~(Figure~\ref{fig:grid}).

A regular grid partitions the region.  The individual pixel size is
relatively coarse $8192 \times 8192$ (m\^2), and designed to reduce
some of the complexity of subsequent regional optimization models.
The projection is an Albers equal area projection with standard
longitude 120\degree West, and parallels at latitudes 41\degree and
47\degree North~\cite{Butler}. This projection insures the pixels
maintain a constant area, while maintaining good conformity for
transportation networks.  The pixel edge length, $8192 = 2^{13}$~(m)
is defined as a binary factor to allow easy scaling up and down of the
data to different resolutions while maintaining common edges.  For
example, the \ac{NLCD} dataset, used in this study, was originally
imported and projected to $2^5$ (m), and aggegated upwards to
determine percentages of each landcover type for each
pixel~(Figure~\ref{fig:land}).

Data processing was carried out within a postgresql database, with the
postgis geospatial extensions~\cite{pgsql,Holl2009,postgis}.
Specialized calculations were implemented as postgresql functions, using
various scripting languages; SQL, PLSQL, Javascript, and R.

\subsection{\acs{3pg} Model Formulation}
\label{sec:3pg}

The \acf{3pg} model~\cite{Landsberg1997, landsberg2010physiological,
  Sands2004} is the primary tool used for the \ac{SRWC} yield
estimations, and takes as inputs weather data, soil parameters, site
factors, including soil parameters, initial stocking conditions,
management practices, and species
definitions~(Figure~\ref{fig:overview}).  The \ac{3pg} model is run at
a monthly timestep. At each step the physiological parameters are
calculated and carried forward to the next month.  These incremental
physiological parameters can be compared to model predictions with
field results at multiple stages in the plantation's history.

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{model_overview}
\caption{ The \ac{3pg} model's main inputs.  Running at a monthly timestep, with
appropriate input parameters, the model predicts tree growth and a
number of other parameters.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The original \ac{3pg} model allocates production from transpiration
into the creation of new roots, stems and foliage.  After coppicing
however, the model has no mechanism to increase start of re-growth
from the root.  A simple coppicing model has been developed to add an
additional production from the root system after
coppicing~\cite{Hart2014}.  When a \ac{SWRC} is coppiced, there is a
surfeit of root mass when compared to the aboveground biomass.  This
surfeit is allowed to contribute some of this surfeit as an additional
production at each monthly timestep, along with the \ac{NPP} of the
original model.  The seasonal timing of any root contribution is
moderated by comparing the actual \ac{NPP} to a potential \ac{NPP} the
tree would have a specified target \ac{LAI}.  This difference serves
as a maximum limit for the root contribution.  Using a potential
\ac{NPP} from a target \ac{LAI} serves two purposes. First, it allows
root contributions up to, but not beyond a certain foliage amount, as
specified by the \ac{LAI}.  More importantly, since the root
contribution is tied to a potential \ac{NPP}, the method times
regrowth with climatic conditions that are favorable for growth, and
does not initiate growth when conditions are not favorable.  A maximum
allowable monthly root contribution fraction limits the total
contribution for any one moneth, and affects the length of time for
the contribution to be made.  In poplar plantations, where plantings
are initiaated with bare cuttings as propogation, the initial growth
is modeled the same way, however with different parameters to model
initial root dynamics.

Hart et. al. validated a set of \ac{3pg} tree parameters that
reasonably model a generic poplar species.  In addition, and set of
variations on these parameters were shown to match other field study
results.

\subsubsection{Climatic and Radiation Data}
\label{sec:climate}

The Pacific Northwest weather patterns are influenced primarily by the
Pacific storm track, which brings in the bulk of precipitation in the
months of October through March, and the location and size of the
mountain ranges, which moderate both the precipitation, and the
temperatures throughout the year.

In order to predict temperatures and precipitation on the near term,
the \acf{PRISM} dataset was used~\cite{Daly2008a}.  \ac{PRISM}
extrapolates station data spatially to a uniform grid using weights
derived from the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid
cell. These similarity measures include location, elevation, coastal
proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer,
topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain.
\ac{PRISM} data is available on a 2.5 minute geographic grid.

16 years of \ac{PRISM} data were interpolated (cubic spline) to the
\ac{AHB} grid averaged to determine a representative weather pattern
used near term modeling for the \ac{AHB} yield predictions.
Figure~\ref{fig:temp} show annual mean temperature and precipitation
variation of the region.  Isolines show the standard deviation between
annual mean temperature to the monthly mean temperature.  Similarly
isolines are shown on the precipitation map.

\begin{figure}[hp]
  \centering  
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{temp}  
\caption{Mean annual Temperature, with isolines showing the standard deviation in monthly temperature.}
  \label{fig:temp}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hp]
  \centering  
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{precip}  
\caption{Total annual rainfall, with iso lines showing the maximum monthly rainfall.}
  \label{fig:precip}
\end{figure}

In order to determine incoming monthly solar radiation, monthly
\acf{NREL} global incident radiation data were
utilized~\cite{perez2002new,nrel-l48-ghi}.  The incident radiation data product
provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource
averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees.  Hourly radiance images
from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and
monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, aerosols are
used to calculate the hourly total direct aand diffuse insolation
falling on a horizontal surface.  Existing ground measurement stations
validate the data where available.

The incident radiation data is available on a gridded format with a
scale similar to this project and is interpolated (cubic-spline)
onto the \ac{AHB} grid for use.

\subsubsection{Soil Parameters}
\label{sec:soil}

\ac{3pg} uses a single layer soil model that maintains an estimate of
the amount of water available at any timestep in the model.  In
addition, \ac{3pg} includes a growth limiter related to the available
water in the soil, and the soil type.  These require a number of soil
parameters.  \ac{maxAWS} determines the maximum holding capacity of
the soil.  

These parameters are all determined using the \acf{STATSGO}
database~\cite{SoilSurveyStaff2012-STATSGO}.  \ac{STATSGO} is a
national soil database, distributed by the \ac{NRCS}.  \ac{STATSGO}
maps are designed for regional studies, and the soil inventories are
typically generalized from more detailed surveys, or from a
combination of ancillary datasets.  Individual \ac{STATSGO} areas can
contain multiple soil components, and the map units are linked to
attributes the soil data base which gives the proportionate extent of
the component soils and their associated properties.  The \ac{mmu} is
about 625 (ha).  For each pixel in the modeling grid, intersecting map
units are averaged for the estimated pixel values.  1887 different
soil were used, contributing anywhere from 144 to 1.3M (ha).

\ac{maxAWS} is directly taken from the \ac{STATSGO} database which
determines the maximium water holding capacity through the complete
soild horizon over the topmost 1 (m) of soil (Figure~\ref{fig:aws}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  Waiting for MaxAWS
  \caption{\ac{STATSGO} derived maximum available water estimates. }
  \label{fig:aws}
\end{figure}

The limiter \ac{fSW} is parameterized with two values, \ac{swp} and
\ac{swc} are functions of the soil type (Figure~\ref{fig:soil}

\begin{equation*}
\acs{fSW} = \frac{1-(1-\acs{AWS}/\acs{maxAWS})^{\acs{swp}}}{1+((1-\acs{AWS}/\acs{maxAWS})/\acs{swc})^{\acs{swp}}}
\end{equation*}

  \label{fig:soil-triangle}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Land Classification and Irrigation}
\label{sec:land}

Available climatic data makes it possible to make estimations for
Poplar growth throughout the \ac{PNW} region.  This may provide
interesting comparisons of changes in yield, but is not very suitable
for determining regional trends, as not all lands are equally likely
to be available for Poplar plantations.  Variables like land
ownership, topography and salinity, influence the technical capability
of growing Poplar.  

In addition, the ability to irrigate a poplar plantation can have
large effects on the predicted yields of poplar.  Determining which
areas in the \ac{PNW} region are liable to be available for irrigation
can significantly influence regional polar harvest estimations.  

% Modify
In order to limit the areas within the \ac{AHB} region to areas that
are technically suitable to poplar plantations, a set of masks were
used, derived from a suitability analysis for potential plantation
locations~\cite{Cooke2014}. Permanently non-suitable land was
identifed for removal from consideration. Lands under Federal
ownership~\cite{NationalAtlasoftheUnitedStates201} and currently
developed land~\cite{nlcd2011} were excluded from consideration.
Physical features including slopes greater than 15\%~\cite{Gesch2007},
and soil salinity greater than 4 (dS / m) were also excluded.

The land suitability study included a other factors for poplar
suitablility; nine variables considered important for poplar growth
were identified: growing season precipitation, temperature, and
length; soil texture and drainage, pH, salinity, and depth; water
table depth; and slope.  Most of these parameters are included more
explicitly in the \ac{3pg} model, and directly affect yield
predictions.  Soil salinity and pH have not yet been integrated into
the \ac{pg} model.

\subsection{Climate Change}
\label{sec:climate}

In order to asses
One climate change scenarios was tested, A1B. 
%
The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very
rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and
declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more
efficient technologies. A1B predicts a balanced utiliziation of
avilable energy sources, defined as not relying too heavily on one
particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement
rates apply to all energy supply and end-use technologies~\cite{}.
%
This represents a commonly used \ac{IPCC} climate change scenario.
Estimations of the expected change in climate came from the IPCC
ensemble estimations~\cite{ipcc-ensemble}.  These estimations are an
amalgamation of 32 different climate change scenarios.  The ensemble
predictions are available at 0.5 minute grid cells.  Estimations of
change in the next fifty years were used in these climate change
estimations.

The \ac{IPCC} estimations cannot be used directly, especially
comparatively to the current estimations using the \ac{PRISM}
data.  This is because when comparing the \ac{IPCC}'s somewhat coarse
scale estimations, to the more detailed \ac{PRISM} estimations the
current (2000-2014) predictions exhibit bias in their estimations.
Therefore, the \ac{IPCC} estimations were used to determine the
predicted change in temperature and precipitation for the \ac {AHB}
region, and these changes were then applied to the current \ac{PRISM}
estimations. For example, the 50 year change in temperature, and
precipitation for the A1B \ac{IPCC} scenario shows a mean
increase in temperature of about ? degrees Celsius, with larger
changes in the foo and the bar.  Mean annual precipitation throughout
the region stays relatively constant, but shows modifications in both
location, and timing of the precipitation do undergo
changes~(Figure~\ref{fig:change}).

  \caption{Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation under \ac{IPCC} sceanario A1B for plantation planted in 2040.}
  \label{fig:change}
\end{figure}

In total, the three \ac{IPCC} scenarios were compared at three
distinct initial planting dates; 2020, 2040 and 2060, and under the
same set of 8 different \ac{3pg} poplar parameterizations, for a total
of 79 estimations per pixel in the \ac{AHB} region.

The mean change in yields are not necessarily a good estimation of
local estimations of changes in yield predictions.  Regional changes
in temperature and precipitation induce considerable heterogeneity in
the yield change estimations.  Looking again, at \ac{IPCC} scenario
A1B, for the 2040-2058 time frame, we see considerable -- blah
blah blah -.  These patterns are somewhat similar to all \ac{IPCC}
scenarios, becoming more pronounced as the estimation is moved into
the future~(Figure~\ref{fig:new-change}.

\end{figure}

Such estimations can inform both the individual farmer in terms of
predicting long term viability of Poplar plantations as a \ac{SRWC}
feedstock, as well as regional estimations on the mid-term ability of
such a feedstock to provide an expected harvest, and therefore an
expected level of biofuel production.  Not only changes in expected
overall yields, but changes in the spatial distribution of the yields
can have impacts on economic analysis of a \ac{SRWC} based biofuel
industry in the \ac{PNW}.  

Next Steps 
With appropriate input information, the \ac{3pg} model can predict
yields for the entire Pacific Northwest study region, under various
irrigation scenarios.  When linked with models of crop adoption,
annual feedstock estimates are possible.

For example, a companion model, the \acf{BCAM} predicts price levels
where poplar competes with existing crops in general cropping regions.
The yield results, along with the \ac{BCAM} predictions can be used in
the \acf{GBSM} in order to optimize where in the region poplar might
be adopted.


For irrigated land, Current yields are input into a \ac{BCAM} model
where they compete with existing crops to determine there economic
viability.  It's hard to add water into the system as a direct cost of
operation, because it's a confusing mush of real costs; availability
and rights.  One way to address this issue is to include water as a
zero-sum game in the adoption model.

For non-irrigated land, marginal and under utilized lands can be
added into the overall agricultural economy as newly minted lands.
These may compete with other agriculture crops, but they can also 

The current model makes these estimations on an 8x8 km2 grid, a
resolution that is fairly taxing for the solver of the \ac{GBSM}
model.  Subsequent model runs at a finer scale can test the best
scales for application of these models.
