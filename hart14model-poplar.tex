\begin{abstract}
  Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability
  of a biofuels industry based on intensively cultivated \acf{SRWC} requires spatial
  predictions of growth and yield under various
  environmental conditions and across large regions.  The \acf{3pg}
  model was modified to evaluate the growth and yield of coppiced
  poplar (\emph{Polulus spp}).  This included developing a sub-model 
  which takes into account the impact of coppicing on post harvest
  regeneration thus extending the applicability of the \acf{3pg} model
  to coppice management regimes.

  The parameterized model was then applied to the entire Pacific
  Northwest of the United States, using appropriate climatological and
  soil input data.  Results predict the yield of poplar cultivation at
  a spatial resolution of $\approx$ 64 km\textsuperscript{2}
  throughout the $\approx$8 million km\textsuperscript{2} of the study
  region. Existing agricultural cultivation patterns were used to
  estimate regional water availability for irrigation, and for
  nonirrigated regions, land cover features including ownership, slope
  , soil salinity and water table depth where used to limit
  predictions to areas with a real potential to support a \ac{SRWC}
  plantation.

  Results can be integrated with other models that allow for
  optimizing the crop selection and biorefinery site selection.
  Important findings from the model include; validation of the
  \ac{3pg} model for coppiced \ac{SRWC} plantings, estimates of
  biomass feedstock yields under different irrigation patterns and
  weather conditions, and annual estimates for feedstock availability
  when combined with crop adoption scenarios.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%% Text of abstract
The \acf{AHB} is a consortium of university and industry partners
investigating the development of a sustainable hardwood biofuels
industry in Washington, Oregon, northern California and northern Idaho
in the United States.  Inspired in part by the U.S. Energy Independence and
Security Act 2022 targets for renewable fuel, \ac{AHB} is carrying out
research and development to support a system for growing and
converting hardwoods, such as hybrid poplars, into liquid biofuels.
This research and development initiative has focused on fuels fully compatible with existing liquid transportation fuel infrastructure.

To support economic and environmental models for a biofuels industry,
spatial predictions of the growth and yield of \acf{SRWC} under
various environmental conditions and throughout the entire \acf{PNW},
the \acf{3pg}\cite{landsberg2010physiological,Landsberg1997,Sands2004}
model was utilized.  Empirically based growth and yield models for
hybrid poplar have been used with some success in the region
\cite{Clendenen1996}, however the samples used to develop allometric
relationships did not include coppice management.
\ac{SECRETS}~\cite{Sampson2001} is another process based model,
differing from \ac{3pg} in a number of ways, including biomass
production and partitioning~\cite{SurendranNair2012}.

The \ac{3pg} model was modified for\ac{SRWC}, particularly
for poplar plantation methodologies. The motivation for the use of
spatially resolved yield estimate is two-fold:
\begin{description}
\item[Biofuels production system optimization] Substantial investment
  is required to construct facilites capable of producing drop-in
  fuels \cite{Parker2010a}. Capitalization of these facilties will
  depend upon a demonstrated
  consistent supply of feedstock. While spot or commodity markets may
  emerge to supply the demand for these facilties via bulk rail or
  marine supply chains, first mover facilities will
  likely depend on contracts with regional producers to supply a
  substantial percent of the facility demand. This analysis helps
  identify locations likely to have access to substantial local
  supply.
\item[Land use] The potential for displacement of food crops from
  agricultural lands is a possible outcome of expanding biofuel
  markets \textbf{Citation}. The impacts associated with an increase in food
  prices on global food security raises ethical issues that relatively
  developed and food-secure societies must consider
  \cite{Pimentel2008}. This exercise helps identify land not currently
  in food production most likely to be viable for \ac{SRWC} production.
\item
\end{description}

The \ac{3pg} model \cite{Landsberg1997} is a forest stand growth model
that predicts total carbon based on photosynthetically active
radiation and is parameterized by soil (water availability) and
weather data. It produces monthly estimates of foliage stem and root
biomass for up to 120 year cycles. In this analysis the \ac{3pg} model
is run for each 16 km\textsuperscript{2} pixel. Each pixel is modeled
as a stand. Input parameters that vary with geography (soil,weather)
are used to parameterize the model for each pixel. The only
modification to the original \ac{3pg} model is the inclusion of a root
contribution to regrowth after coppice which is discussed in more
detail in Section ~\ref{sec:3pg}

A physiological growth model such as \ac{3pg} is advantageous because
it allows variation of growth parameters and assumptions regarding
management practices for poplar species.  In addition to biomass
growth and yield estimations, allocations for both above and below
ground biomass can be tracked for life-cycle analysis of the product
fuels.  This is because carbon allocations are balanced in the model.

The \ac{3pg} model has been used extensively to model \ac{SRWC}
production. \citet{Amichev2010} used the \ac{3pg} to predict growth of
the Walker poplar hybrid (\textit{Populus deltoides} x \textit{Populus
  nigra}) in Saskatchewan, Canada. This analysis did not investigate
the growth dynamics related to coppicing. \citet{Deckmyn2004} modified
and evaluated the \ac{SECRETS} for coppice poplar production from two
varieties under a range of soil fertility conditions.  The
\ac{SECRETS} coppice modified paritioning fractions with the presence
of a large root mass, one of the outcomes of the coppicing model
described here for \ac{3pg}.

\citet{Headlee2012} deployed the \ac{3pg} model across several states
in the northern midwest to predict growth and yield of hybrid poplar
but did ot incorporate coppice management into the model.  To date,
the use of physiological growth models such as the \ac{3pg} to
evaluate spatial variability in yields of coppiced \ac{SRWC} at the
scale and extent of the results presented here has not been attempted.

The original \ac{3pg} model does not include coppicing as a management
practice, which is problematic as it cannot reasonably account for
post-coppicing regrowth.  Coppicing of \ac{SRWC} has been widely
demonstrated to increase growth rates post-coppice in comparison to
un-coppiced stands
\cite{Verwijst1996,Afas2008a,Sennerby-Forsse1992}. Thus, to employ the
\ac{3pg} model in coppice management, the original model must be
modified to reflect this increased productivity. The extended model
presented in this paper includes coppicing with a general model that
allows a monthly growth contribution from an existing root mass.  The
model specifies a relatively small contribution of aboveground growth
from the accumulated root mass after coppicing in order to initiate
the next cycle of production \cite{Deckmyn2004}.

With appropriate input information, the \ac{3pg} model can predict
yields for the entire Pacific Northwest study region, under various
irrigation scenarios.  When linked with models of crop adoption,
annual feedstock estimates are possible.

\section{Methods and Calculation}

The main goal of this study was to create spatially explicit poplar
growth potential for the \ac{PNW} that can reliably predicted yield from \ac{SRWC}
plantations in the region.

The study area, the Pacific Northwest of the United States,
includes Washington, Oregon, Northern California, and Western
Idaho.  A regular grid partitions the region.  The individual pixel size is
relatively coarse $8192 \times 8192$ (m\^2), and designed to reduce
some of the complexity of subsequent regional optimization models.
The projection is an Albers equal area projection with standard
longitude 120\degree West, and parallels at latitudes 41\degree and
47\degree North~\cite{Butler}. This projection insures the pixels
maintain a constant area, while maintaining good conformity for
transportation networks.  The pixel edge length, $8192 = 2^{13}$~(m)
is defined as a binary factor to allow easy scaling up and down of the
data to different resolutions while maintaining common edges.  For
example, the \ac{NLCD} dataset, used in this study, was originally
imported and projected to $2^5$ (m), and aggregated upwards to
determine percentages of each landcover type for each
pixel~(Figure~\ref{fig:land}).

Data processing was carried out within a postgresql database, with the
postgis geospatial extensions~\cite{Momjian2001,Holl2009}.  The
\ac{3pg} model implemented directly in the postgresql database via
user-defined functions.  These function were implemented in
Javascript, so a single library could support this study, and an
online application~\cite{Prilepova2014}.

\subsection{\acs{3pg} Model Formulation}
\label{sec:3pg}

The \acf{3pg} model~\cite{Landsberg1997, landsberg2010physiological,
  Sands2004} is the primary tool used for the \ac{SRWC} yield
estimations, and takes as inputs weather data, soil parameters, site
factors, initial stocking conditions, management practices, and
species definitions.  The \ac{3pg} model is run at a monthly
timestep. At each step the physiological parameters are calculated and
carried forward to the next month.
% Not sure bout this
%Introduction of coppicing into the model may result in
%divergence of modeled results with empirical data depending upon the
%point in time within the month that coppicing is conducted. The
%\ac{3PG} model assumes a full month timestep when estimating growth,
%thus if coppice operations for validation stands are conducted near
%the end of a month the model estimation would overestimate the
%post-coppice regereration.
These incremental physiological parameters
can be compared to model predictions with field results at multiple
stages in the plantation's history.

A few studies have specifically modeled poplar using the 3PG
model~\cite{Amichev2010,Headlee2012}. Headlee~\cite{Headlee2012} in
particular, developed parameters from a review of laboratory and field
studies to represent the growth of a representative hybrid poplar.
Alternatively, there have been several reported field tests on
coppiced poplar
plantations~\cite{Proe2002,Proe1999,Pontailler1999,Afas2008a} that
show large variations in above ground biomass production among
different poplar species.  To represent this variability, a strategy
was used where a set of default input values were modified on a per
variety basis to match field reported production.  All sets were all
run on the region, and the average production was reported.

A \emph{base} parameter set is altered for five additional parameter
sets estimated from
Pontailler~\cite{Pontailler1999,pontailler97-volume-index,Ceulemans1993},
a field test that described biomass measurements over 5 two year
coppicing events for a five different poplar species, grown in Orsay,
France from 1987 through 1997. The clones studied included fast
growing, interspecific Interamerican (\textit{Populus trichocarpa
  $\times$ P deltoides}) hybrid clones (Parameter sets \emph{Beaupre}
and \emph{Raspalje}), a native American \textit{P. trichocarpa}
(\emph{Fritzi Pauley}) and one Euramerican reference clone
\textit{P.~deltoides $\times$ P.~nigra}, cv., (\emph{Robusta}).

The \ac{3pg} model was modified in two ways to allow modeling of
\ac{SRWC}; a modification to the allocation of biomass among roots,
foliage and stem, and the inclusion of a coppicing model.

An important component of 3PG is the allocations of \ac{NPP}~to \ac{WR}, \ac{WS}, and
\ac{WS}.  This is controlled primarily with the \ac{pfs}, the ratio of \ac{WF}~to \ac{WS},
$\ac{pfs}=\ac{WF}/\ac{WS}$, which helps determine the aboveground allocations.  \ac{pfs}~is in
turn calculated from a pair of allometric relations.  In 3PG, \ac{pfs}~is obtained
in a two step process, first obtaining an estimate of \ac{dbh}~from the current \ac{WS},
and then using \ac{dbh}~to determine \ac{pfs}~through a measured relationship.  These
relations are typically determined from comparisons of more mature trees, for
example, Headlee's estimates are based on poplars with a range in \ac{dbh}~of about
3.5~-~25 (cm)~\cite{Headlee2012}%,Fortier2010}.

For \ac{SRWC}, Pontailler et al.~\cite{pontailler97-volume-index}
proposed a set of parameterizations based on \ac{VI} where $VI =
HD^2$, $H$ is height (m), and $D$ is tree diameter (m) at 22cm.  They
described power relationships between \ac{VI}~and both above ground
dry matter and leaf area per stem. These can be used in a similar
manner to define \ac{pfs}, where \ac{WS}~is used to estimate
\ac{VI}~with \ac{sps} specified and \ac{VI} then used to predict
\ac{LA} and along with \ac{SLA}, \ac{WF}~and \ac{pfs}. As these
relationships were defined for each poplar variation in the field
tests, the 3PG model was modified to calculate \ac{pfs}~with these
relationships, and the model run with the parameters shown in
Table~\ref{tab:pont-3pg}.  In that table, the parameter set Base, is
an otherwise unmodified base set of poplar parameter assumptions.

\begin{table}%[p]

  \end{tabular}
  \begin{flushleft}$DM=\ac{sps}(\beta_{DM} VI^{\gamma_{DM}})$, and $LA = \beta_{LA} VI^{\gamma_{LA}}$~\cite{pontailler97-volume-index}.
\end{flushleft}  
\label{tab:pont-3pg}
\end{table}

Two additional parameter sets HW1 and HW2 used the original
\ac{pfs}~formulation; $DM=\ac{sps}(C_{stem} \ac{dbh}^{P_{stem}})$, and $\ac{pfs} =
C_{pfs} \ac{dbh}^{P_{pfs}}$, with $\ac{sps}=2.8$, $C_{stem}=0.18$,
$P_{stem}=2.4$, $C_{pfs}=1.92$, $P_{pfs}=-1.162$ for HW1 and $\ac{sps}=1$,
$C_{stem}=0.08$, $P_{stem}=2.46$, $C_{pfs}=1.2$, $P_{pfs}=-0.77$ for
HW2 with a maximum allowable $\ac{pfs}=2$, when the coppiced trees small.

In \ac{3pg} foilage is required for growth.  After coppicing however,
with no foliage, there is no mechanism for initial regrowth. A simple
coppicing model has been developed to transfer biomass from the root
system to the regenerating foliage after coppicing.  When a \ac{SRWC}
is coppiced thee is no foliage, but extra root mass.  In the coppice
submodel, this surfeit is allowed to contribute to production,
\ac{RP}~at each monthly timestep.  The seasonal timing of any root
contribution is moderated by comparing a monthly \ac{NPP} to a
productivity (\ac{NPPt})~the tree would have for a target
\ac{LAIt}. $\ac{NPPt}-\ac{NPP}$ serves as a limit on the root
contribution.  Using a potential \ac{NPPt} serves two purposes. First,
it allows root contributions up to, but not beyond a certain foliage
amount, as specified by the \ac{LAI}.  More importantly, since the
root contribution is regulated by \ac{NPP}, the method times regrowth
with conditions that are favorable, and does not initiate growth when
conditions are not.  

Excess root mass needs to exist of course.  \ac{3pg} specifies a
\ac{pRx}, and excess root is the difference of this from the fraction
of \ac{WS} and \ac{W}, $\ac{WR}(\ac{WR}/\acs{W}-\acs{pRx})$.  \ac{Rdp}
limits the contribution of this excess to the small fraction that can
be used for regrowth. \ac{Rdp} affects both the amount and the timeliness where
contributions are made.  In poplar, starch and sugar content can be as
much as 20\% in coarse roots, though this varies
seasonally~\cite{Regier2010}.

With an additional \ac{Re} for transfer from root to above ground
biomass, per-month $\ac{RP} =
\ac{WR}(\ac{WR}/\acs{W}-\ac{pRx})\ac{Rdp}*\ac{Re}$, subject to the
constraint that $\ac{RP} <= \ac{NPPt}-\ac{NPP})$.

In poplar plantations, where plantings are initiated with bare
cuttings as propagation, the initial growth is modeled the same way,
however with different parameters to model initial root dynamics.
Table~\ref{tab:3pg-tree-coppice} shows the values used for the
coppicing calculations, both for the initial cuttings and the coppiced
trees.  These values were used for all parameter sets.

\begin{table}%[p]
\caption{3PG Coppicing Parameters}
\input{tree_coppice.tex}
\label{tab:3pg-tree-coppice}
 \end{table}

 Even with changes in the \ac{pfs}~calculations and the coppice model,
 contributions to the root mass are a fraction of \ac{NPP} ranging
 from a minimum to maximum as determined by the plant stress and
 nutrition, as in the original \ac{3pg} model.  These values, along
 with root turnover and litterfall are shown in
 table~\ref{tab:3pg-tree-allocate}.

used to match reported variation in the five poplar types.  The lines

\emph{base} parameter set.  The dots indicate reported stem biomass at

 Each parameter set was then applied to the entire Pacific Northwest
 region, using appropriate climatology and soil input data.  Climate
 data included both historical patterns as well as predicted patterns
 from simulations predicting climate change.  These inputs produce
 poplar yield prediction maps and expected bounds on the variation of
 these yields useful for determining when it becomes economically
 feasible for poplar to be grown within the study area.

This yield model is overlaid with surface and land cover
parameters to predict yields for potential plantation locations.
Yield maps are the average yield from the seven parameter sets over the
entire \ac{AHB} region. 


\subsubsection{Climatic and Radiation Data}
\label{sec:climate}

%http://cses.washington.edu/cig/pnwc/pnwc.shtml
%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_California

The Pacific Northwest weather patterns are influenced primarily by the
Pacific storm track, which brings in the bulk of precipitation in the
months of October through March, and the location and size of the
mountain ranges, which moderate both the precipitation, and the
temperatures throughout the year.

In order to predict temperatures and precipitation on the near term,
the \acf{PRISM} dataset was used~\cite{Daly2008a}.  \ac{PRISM}
extrapolates station data spatially to a uniform grid using weights
derived from the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid
cell. These similarity measures include location, elevation, coastal
proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer,
topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain.
\ac{PRISM} data is available on a 2.5 minute geographic grid.

16 years of \ac{PRISM} data were interpolated (cubic spline) to the
\ac{AHB} grid averaged to determine a representative weather pattern
used near term modeling for the \ac{AHB} yield predictions.
Figure~\ref{fig:temp} shows annual mean temperature and total
precipitation variation of the region.  Isolines show the standard
deviation between annual mean temperature to the monthly mean
temperature.  Similarly isolines shown on the precipitation map show
the maximum monthly contribution of precipitation.

\begin{figure}[hp]
  \centering  
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{temp}  
\caption{Mean annual temperature, with isolines showing the standard deviation in monthly temperature.}
  \label{fig:temp}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hp]
  \centering  
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{precip}  
\caption{Total annual preciptation, with iso lines showing the maximum monthly precipitation.}
  \label{fig:precip}
\end{figure}

In order to determine incoming monthly solar radiation, monthly
\acf{NREL} global incident radiation data were
utilized~\cite{perez2002new,nrel-l48-ghi}.  The incident radiation data product
provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource
averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees.  Hourly radiance images
from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and
monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, aerosols are
used to calculate the hourly total direct and diffuse insolation
falling on a horizontal surface.  Existing ground measurement stations
validate the data where available.

The incident radiation data is available on a gridded format with a
scale similar to this project and is interpolated (cubic-spline)
onto the \ac{AHB} grid for use.

\subsubsection{Soil Parameters}
\label{sec:soil}

\ac{3pg} uses a single layer soil model that maintains an estimate of
the amount of water available at any timestep in the model.  In
addition, \ac{3pg} includes a growth limiter related to the available
water in the soil, and the soil type.  These require a number of soil
parameters.

These parameters are all determined using the \acf{STATSGO}
database~\cite{SoilSurveyStaff2012-STATSGO}.  \ac{STATSGO} is a
national soil database, distributed by the \ac{NRCS}.  \ac{STATSGO}
maps are designed for regional studies, and the soil inventories are
typically generalized from more detailed surveys, or from a
combination of ancillary datasets.  Individual \ac{STATSGO} areas can
contain multiple soil components, and the map units are linked to
attributes the soil data base which gives the proportionate extent of
the component soils and their associated properties.  The \ac{mmu} is
about 625 (ha).  For each pixel in the modeling grid, intersecting map
units are averaged for the estimated pixel values.  1887 different
soil were used, contributing anywhere from 144 to 1.3M (ha).

\ac{maxAWS} defines the maximum holding capacity of the soil.
\ac{maxAWS} is directly taken from the \ac{STATSGO} database which
determines the maximum water holding capacity through the complete
horizon over the topmost 1 (m) of soil (Figure~\ref{fig:aws}).

The limiter \ac{fSW} is parameterized with two values, \ac{swp} and
\ac{swc} are functions of the soil type (Figure~\ref{fig:soil-triangle}).  The
soil type is determined from \ac{STATSGO} report  percentages of
silt sand and clay within each soil component.

\subsection{Land Classification and Irrigation}
\label{sec:land}

Available climatic data makes it possible to make estimations for
poplar growth throughout the \ac{PNW} region.  This may provide
interesting comparisons of changes in yield, but is not very suitable
for determining regional trends, as not all lands are equally likely
to be available for poplar plantations.  Variables like land
ownership, topography and salinity, influence the technical capability
of growing poplar.  

In addition, the ability to irrigate a poplar plantation can have
large effects on the predicted yields of poplar.  Determining which
areas in the \ac{PNW} region are liable to be available for irrigation
can significantly influence regional polar harvest estimations.  

In order to limit the areas within the \ac{AHB} region to areas that
are technically suitable to poplar plantations, a set of masks were
used, derived from a suitability analysis for potential plantation
locations~\cite{Cooke2014}. Permanently non-suitable land was
identified for removal from consideration. Lands under Federal
ownership~\cite{NationalAtlasoftheUnitedStates2013} and currently
developed land were excluded from consideration.
Physical features including slopes greater than 15\%~\cite{Gesch2007},
and soil salinity greater than 4 (dS / m) were also
excluded~(Figure~\ref{fig:nonirrigated_yield}).

The land suitability study included other factors for poplar
suitability; nine variables considered important for poplar growth
were identified: growing season precipitation, temperature, and
length; soil texture and drainage, pH, salinity, and depth; water
table depth; and slope.  Most of these parameters are included more
explicitly in the \ac{3pg} model, and directly affect yield
predictions.  Soil salinity and pH have not yet been integrated into
the \ac{3pg} model.

Available water for irrigation is a difficult question when dealing
with crops in the \ac{PNW}.  Irrigation is a combination of
availability and rights, that is hard to track on a regional scale.
However, one aspect of irrigation is that if it's available it is
likely being used currently.  Therefore, for determining irrigated
yield predictions for poplar, a mask of existing irrigated
agricultural areas was used.  These locations were determined in two
steps.  First, the a cropland data layer was used to spatially locate
agricultural crops in the region.  The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer
(CDL) is a nationally available raster of crop specific land cover
data layer with a ground resolution of 30 meters.  The CDL is produced
using satellite imagery with a classification emphasis on agricultural
land cover~\cite{cdl2011}.  The CDL was projected unto the \ac{AHB}
region as a scale of $2^5$.  Individual pixels from the CDL were then
aggregated within the larger model's $2^{13}$ size pixels to determine
fractional composition of each large pixel~(Figure~\ref{fig:land}).  An
additional step was used to adjust the total area in each county to
the values of hectares reported to the \ac{NASS}.  \ac{NASS} publishes
U.S., State and County agricultural statistics for many
commodities~\cite{nass-quick-stats}.  Later modeling efforts rely on
the \ac{NASS} reported hectares of the various commodities harvested.
This was accomplished by uniformly adjusting the CDL derived pixel
fractions, (the \ac{AHB} 8192 edge length pixels) so that sum of pixel
fractions over nay county in the \ac{AHB} region match the reported
number of hectares harvested for that county and commodity.  This
method allows the spatial patterns of the CDL to be retained with
fractions that add to the \ac{NASS} reported values.

\subsection{Climate Change}

To demonstrate the effect of potential climate change on yield
predictions in the near future, the A1B climate change scenario was
used as an example for predicting yields with a plantation initially
planted in 2040.

The A1B scenario predicts a balanced utilization of available energy
sources, with similar improvement rates applied to all energy supply
and end-use.  The future is one of rapid economic growth, global
population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and a
rapid introduction of new and more efficient
technologies~\cite{IPCC2007,Parry2007}.

Estimations of the expected change in temperature and precipitation
were derived from the \ac{CCSM3}.  The \ac{CCSM3} is a climate model
with components including the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land
surface. \ac{CCSM3} is designed to produce realistic simulations over
a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions.  \ac{CCSM3}
predictions are available at 0.5 degree grid cells.  Estimations of
change in the next fifty years were used in these climate change
estimations.

The \ac{CCSM3} estimations cannot be used directly, especially
comparatively to the current estimations using the \ac{PRISM} data.
This is because when comparing the \ac{CCSM3}'s somewhat coarse scale
estimations to the more detailed \ac{PRISM} estimations the current
(2000-2014) predictions exhibit bias.  Therefore, the \ac{CCSM3}
estimations were used to determine the predicted change in temperature
and precipitation for the \ac {AHB} region, and these changes were
then applied to the current \ac{PRISM} estimations. For example, the
40 year change in temperature, and precipitation for the A1B scenario
shows a mean increase in temperature of about 1\degree Celsius, with
larger changes in the South and West.  Mean annual precipitation
decreases by about 100 (mm) throughout the region with larger changes
in along the coast~(Figure~\ref{fig:change}).

\section{Results and Discussion}

The \ac{3pg} model was run with seven representative poplar
parameterizations were run over the \ac{AHB} region, using both a
model that included irrigation and one that was nonirrigated.  The
results were averaged over the set of species parameters.  The runs
were over an 18 total lifetime, with a 2.5 year initial coppicing
event followed by 5 additional events on a three year cycle.  Initial
planting was in March, with all coppicing events occurring in
November.  The 6 total harvest events were annualized over the 18 year
time span to report predicted yields on a per year basis.

Finally, the layer of current croplands was used to mask the yield
maps to include only those areas where irrigation is likely, to
determine an overall predicted irrigated yield.  The results show an
average yield over the entire region of 19.7 (Mg/ha).  38000 ($km^2$) were
included in the estimate.  Yields were highest in the central valley
of California, a rich agricultural center, with similar yields along
the temperate western parts of Oregon and Washington.  Yields
decreased in the Northern plains, reaching lows in the Northeastern
section of the study region~(Figure~\ref{fig:irrigated_yield}).

The image only includes pixels with more that \%20 area identified as cropland.  The isolines on the maps describe the standard deviation over the 7 parameterizations.}
  \label{fig:irrigated_yield}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the nonirrigated yield predictions were masked with the
areas excluded in the land suitability study to include those areas
likely to support nonirrigated poplar plantations.  Results for the
nonirrigated lands predict a yield of 6.6 (Mg/ha) over an area under
consideration of 57000 ($km^2$).  In the case of nonirrigated yields, the
highest yields were along the Pacific coast where precipitation is
most plentiful, and more uniform in the inland areas of the \ac{AHB}
region~(Figure~\ref{fig:nonirrigated_yield}).

\end{figure}

%\subsection{Climate Change}
%\label{sec:climate-change}

To assess the predicted change in yields from the A1B example study,
the model was rerun with the same parameters as the previously, but
with the predicted changes in temperature and precipitation.  The
results were averaged and summarized as above to determine annualized
yields.  The yields were then compared to the current yield estimates
to determine the difference in predicted yields under that one example
climate change scenario.  

Under irrigated conditions, the higher predicted temperatures
generally improve yields through most of the region, with the
exception of California, where high temperatures often limit monthly
growth.  Changes in yield are modest in the areas with the highest
yields and more significant in the colder northern and central
regions~(Figure~\ref{fig:new_irrigated}).
 
\begin{figure}[hp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{climate_irrigated}
  \caption{Changes in predicted irrigated yield for \ac{CCSM3} scenario A1B
    for a plantation planting in 2040-2058.}
  \label{fig:new_irrigated}
\end{figure}

For nonirrigated plantations, the predicted decrease in precipitation
decreases yields along the areas with the current highest yields,
along the wet Pacific coast.  Higher temperatures continue to increase
yields in most of the inland areas~(Figure~\ref{fig:new_nonirrigated})

\begin{figure}[hp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{climate_nonirrigated}
  \caption{Changes in predicted nonirrigated yield for \ac{IPCC} scenario A1B
    for a plantation planting in 2040-2058.}
  \label{fig:new_nonirrigated}
\end{figure}

These change estimations can inform both the individual farmer in terms of
predicting long term viability of poplar plantations as a \ac{SRWC}
feedstock, as well as regional estimations on the mid-term ability of
such a feedstock to provide an expected harvest, and therefore an
expected level of biofuel production.  Not only changes in expected
overall yields, but changes in the spatial distribution of the yields
can have impacts on economic analysis of a \ac{SRWC} based biofuel
industry in the \ac{PNW}.  

These example climate change yield change predictions are
illustrative, but the mean change in yields are not necessarily the
most robust estimation of changes in yield predictions.  First, the
\ac{CCSM3} models are not tuned to the relatively short time frame of
looking forward 25-50 years.  In addition, while temperature increases
are consistently predicted, the change in precipitation is less
uniformly predicted among different models and scenarios. 

With appropriate input information, the \ac{3pg} model can predict
yields for the entire \ac{PNW} study region, under various irrigation
scenarios.  When linked with models of crop adoption and biorefinery
models the economic viability of poplar as a biofuel feedstock can be
examined.
 
For example, in the \ac{AHB} project, a companion model, the
\acf{BCAM}, predicts price levels where poplar competes with existing
crops in about 35 different general cropping regions in the \ac{PNW}.
The spatially distributed yield predictions inform the \ac{BCAM}
model.  For irrigated land, current yields are input into a \ac{BCAM}
model where they compete with existing crops to determine their
economic viability.  The yield predictions also include predictions in
required water, and the \ac{BCAM} model manages water availability by
balancing any water needs from the poplar with water saved from crops
taken out of the agricultural system.  Outputs of the \ac{BCAM} model
show at what farm gate price (\$/Mg) poplar becomes an economically
viable product.
 
For non-irrigated land, marginal and under utilized lands can be added
into the overall agricultural economy as newly utilized lands.  For
nonirrigated plantations, crop budgets can give estimates of farm gate
costs (\$/Mg) which are affected by the predicted yields.

Both the irrigated and nonirrigated regions, total amount of available
feedstock for a particular farm gate price can then be estimated.
These are also spatially distributed.  Another \ac{AHB} model, the
\acf{GBSM} takes as inputs these spatially distributed price curves,
and use them in coordination with feedstock transport and refinery
costs, to optimize the size and location of a set of refineries, to
most efficiently process the poplar into a biofuel.  The results from
the \ac{GBSM} model include both the predicted refinery system as well
as an anticipated cost of fuel itself.  The current resolution of the
\ac{AHB} grid is designed to provide a workable input for the solver
of the \ac{GBSM} model.  Subsequent model runs at a finer scale can
test the best scales for application of these models.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclude}

With the addition of the coppicing model, the \ac{3pg} model can be
used to predict poplar yields for the \ac{PNW} region.  The model can
include irrigation which increases yields from most areas in the region.  

With additional layers showing current croplands, areas the can be
irrigated are identified.  Poplar suitability maps limit consideration
on nonirrigated plantations to regions that are amenable to such
management.

Spatially distributed yield predictions inform regional models as to
the expected costs of producing a poplar biofuel feedstock and the
price at which that commodity becomes economically viable.
