%% Text of abstract
  The \acf{AHB} is a consortium of university and industry partners
  investigating the development of a sustainable hardwood biofuels
  industry in Washington, Oregon, Northern California and Northern
  Idaho in the U.S.  Inspired in part by the U.S. Energy Independence
  and Security Act 2022 targets for renewable fuel (renewable fuel
  standard), \ac{AHB} is carrying out research and development to
  support a system for growing and converting hardwoods, such as
  hybrid poplars, into liquid biofuels that are fully compatible with
  existing infrastructure.

  Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability
  of a biofuels industry based on this feedstock requires spatial
  predictions of the growth and yield of \acf{SRWC} under various
  environmental conditions and throughout the entire Pacific Northwest
  region.  The \acf{3pg} model was selected and modified for \ac{SRWC},
  particularly for poplar plantation methodologies.  This included
  developing a sub-model which takes into account the coppicing
  strategy for harvesting poplar.

  A physiological growth model such as \ac{3pg} is advantageous because it
  allows variation of growth parameters and assumptions regarding
  management practices for poplar species.  Because it is a canopy
  carbon balance model, allocations for both above and below ground
  biomass can be tracked for life-cycle analysis of the product fuels.

  The original \ac{3pg} model does not include coppicing as a management
  practice, which is problematic as it cannot reasonably account for
  post-coppicing regrowth.  The extended model includes coppicing with
  a general model that allows a monthly growth contribution from an
  existing root mass.  The model specifies a relatively small
  contribution of aboveground growth from the accumulated root mass
  after coppicing in order to initiate the next cycle of production.

  The \ac{3pg} model was validated against a number of field studies
  related to the growth of poplar as a \ac{SRWC} biofuel feedstock.  The
  parameterized model was then applied to the entire Pacific Northwest
  region, using appropriate climatology and soil input data.
  Climate data included both historical patterns as well as predicted
  patterns from simulations under various climate scenarios.  The
  result was a map of predicted yields and expected bounds on the
  variation of these yields useful for determining when it becomes
  economically feasible for poplar to be grown within the study
  area. Results were integrated with other models that allow for
  optimizing the crop selection and biorefinery site selection.
  Important findings from the model include; validation of the \ac{3pg}
  model for coppiced \ac{SRWC} plantings, estimates of biomass feedstock
  yields under different irrigation patterns and weather conditions,
  and annual estimates for feedstock availability when combined with
  crop adoption scenarios.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Using weather and soil parameters along with the \ac{3pg} forest
growth model, yield predictions for poplar plantations can be made for
the entire Pacific Northwest.  This yield model can be overlaid with
land use patterns to predict yields for potential plantation
locations.  Yield maps are the results of running the \ac{3pg} Model for
the entire \ac{AHB} region. Weather information is derived from the PRISM
Climate Group~\cite{Daly2008a} and the \acf{NREL} monthly radiation
data (Marion, 1994). Soils data is derived from
\acf{STATSGO}~cite{soil-statsgo2012}.

With appropriate input information, the \ac{3pg} model can predict
yields for the entire Pacific Northwest study region, under various
irrigation scenarios.  When linked with models of crop adoption,
annual feedstock estimates are possible.

For example, a companion model, the \acf{BCAM} predicts price levels
where poplar competes with existing crops in general cropping regions.
The yield results, along with the \ac{BCAM} predictions can be used in
the \acf{GBSM} in order to optimize where in the region poplar might
be adopted.

The current model makes these estimations on an 8x8 km2 grid, a
resolution that is fairly taxing for the solver of the \ac{GBSM}
model.  Subsequent model runs at a finer scale can test the best
scales for application of these models.

\section{Methods and Calculation}

The goal of this study is to create a map of poplar growth potential
for this region that can inform our participants, and subsequent
models on the predicted yields from \ac{SRWC} plantations.

Figure~\ref{fig:grid} shows the study area, the Pacific Northwest of
the United States, incorporating Washington, Oregon, Northern
California, and Western Idaho.  This definition of the Pacific
Northwest is somewhat inclusive in the South, including the northern
part of California.

A regular grid is used to partition the region.  The initial size of
the grid is relatively coarse $8192 \times 8192$ (m x m), and designed
to reduce some of the complexity of our regional optimization models.
The projection is an Albers equal area projection with standard
longitude 120\degree West, and parallels at latitudes 41\degree and
47\degree North~\cite{Butler}. This somewhat specialized projection
insures the pixels maintain a constant area, while maintaining good
conformity for our transportation networks.  The pixel size is
$2^{13}$ (m).  This allows easy scaling up and down of the data to
different resolutions while maintaining common edges.  For example,
the \ac{NLCD} dataset, used in this study, was originally imported at
$2^5$ (m), and scaled upwards to determine percentages of landcover
for each pixel.

Data processing was carried out with a postgresql database, with the
postgis geospatial extensions~\cite{pgsql,Holl2009,postgis}.
Specialized calculations were implemented as postgresql functions, using
various scripting languages; SQL, PLSQL, Javascript, and R.

\subsection{\acs{3pg} Model Formulation}
\label{sec:3pg}

The \acf{3pg} model~\cite{Landsberg1997, landsberg2010physiological,
  Sands2004} takes as inputs weather data, and site factors, including
soil parameters, initial stocking conditions, management practices,
and species definitions.  In this study, the \ac{3pg} model is run at
a monthly timestep. At each step the physiological parameters are
calculated and carried forward to the next month.  These incremental
physiological parameters can be plotted to compare model predictions
with field results at multiple stages in the plantation’s history.
Figure~\ref{fig:overview} gives an overview of the \acf{3pg} model.

\begin{figure}[p]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{model_overview}
\caption{ The \ac{3pg} model's main inputs.  Running at a monthly timestep, with
appropriate input parameters, the model predicts tree growth and a
number of other parameters.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The original \ac{3pg} model allocates mass produced from transpiration
into the the creation of new roots, stems and foliage.  After
coppicing however, the model has no mechanism to increase start of
re-growth from the root.  A simple coppicing model has been developed
to add an additional production from the root system after
coppicing\cite{Hart2014}.  The seasonal timing of the
contribution is moderated by comparing the actual \ac{NPP} to the
\ac{NPP} the root could produce if it had a more complete canopy.
This difference serves as a target for the root contribution.  This
method times regrowth with climatic conditions that are favorable for
growth.  The monthly root contribution affects the length of time for
the contribution to be made.  In poplar plantations, the initial
planting is modeled the same way, however with different parameters to
model initial propagation methods.

\subsubsection{Climatic and Radiation Data}
\label{sec:climate}

%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_California

The Pacific Northwest weather patterns are influenced primarily by the
Pacific storm track, which brings in the bulk of precipitation in the
months of October through March, and the location and size of the
mountain ranges, which moderate both the precipitation, and the
temperatures throughout the year.

In order to predict temperatures and precipitation on the near term,
the \acf{PRISM} dataset was used.  \ac{PRISM} extrapolates station
data spatially to a uniform grid using weights derived from the
physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. These
similarity measures include location, elevation, coastal proximity,
topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic
position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain.  \ac{PRISM}
data is available on a 2.5 minute geographic grid.

16 years of \ac{PRISM} data were interpolated (cubic spline) to the
\ac{AHB} grid averaged to determine a representative weather pattern
used near term modeling for the \ac{AHB} yield predictions.
Figure~\ref{fig:temp} show annual mean temperature and precipitation
variation of the region.  Isolines show the standard deviation between
annual mean temperature to the monthly mean temperature.  Similarly
isolines are shown on the precipitation map.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Soil Parameters}
\label{sec:soil}

\ac{3pg} uses a single layer soil model that maintains an estimate of
the amount of water available at any timestep in the model.  In
addition, \ac{3pg} includes a growth limiter related to the available
water in the soil, and the soil type.  These require a number of soil
parameters.  \ac{maxAWS} determines the maximum holding capacity of
the soil.  The limiter \ac{fSW} is parameterized with two values,

\begin{equation*}
\acs{fSW} = \frac{1-(1-\acs{AWS}/\acs{maxAWS})^{\acs{swp}}}{1+((1-\acs{AWS}/\acs{maxAWS})/\acs{swc})^{\acs{swp}}}
\end{equation*} 

where \ac{swp} and \ac{swc} are functions of the soil type.

These parameters are all determined using the \ac{STATSGO} database.
\ac{STATSGO} is a national soil database, distributed by the
\ac{NRCS}.  \ac{STATSGO} maps are designed for regional studies, and
the soil inventories are typically generalized from more detailed
surveys, or from a combination of ancillary datasets.  Individual
\ac{STATSGO} areas can contain multiple soil components, and the map
units are linked to attributes the soil data base which gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and their associated
properties.  The \ac{mmu} is about 625 (ha).  For each pixel in the
modeling grid, intersecting map units are averaged for the estimated
pixel values.  1887 different soil were used, contributing anywhere
from 144 to 1.3M (ha).

\ac{maxAWS} is directly taken from the \ac{STATSGO} database which
Figure~\ref{fig:aws} shows the \ac{maxAWS} estimates.

Included in the figure are the lines designating the soil polygons
used.

\subsection{Land Classification and Irrigation}
\label{sec:land}

Available climatic data makes it possible to make estimations for
Poplar growth throughout the \ac{PNW} region.  This may provide
interesting comparisons of changes in yield, but is not very suitable
for determining regional trends, as not all lands are equally likely
to be available for Poplar plantations.  Variables like land
ownership, topography and salinity, influence the technical capability
of growing Poplar.  

In addition, the ability to irrigate a poplar plantation can have
large effects on the predicted yields of poplar.  Determining which
areas in the \ac{PNW} region are liable to be available for irrigation
can significantly influence regional polar harvest estimations.  

% Abstract A suitability analysis for potential to grow poplar was performed over the five state region using the analytic hierarchy process. First, permanently non-suitable land was removed, including Federal ownership, developed land, slopes greater than 15%, and soil salinity greater than 4 deciSiemens per meter. For remaining land, nine variables considered important for poplar growth were identified: growing season precipitation, temperature, and length; soil texture and drainage, pH, salinity, and depth; water table depth; and slope. Normalizing functions were developed for each variable, and contribution to overall suitability was defined by assigning pairwise importance weights. Normalized values and weights were multiplied together to calculate a final suitability value for each cell. Finally, cells were classified into Highly, Moderately, Marginally or Currently Not Suitable.
% Of the 354 million acres in the region, 188 million acres were identified as permanently non-suitable due to Federal ownership, development, presence of water bodies, steep slopes, or high soil salinity. Without irrigation, 4.4 million acres were classified as highly suitable, with 400 thousand of these acres not classified as agriculture, forestry, disturbed, developed, or water. Irrigation increased the amount of highly suitable acres to 54 million, with 20 million acres not classified agriculture, forestry, disturbed, developed, or water. Growing season precipitation was the most important factor under the without irrigation scenario. When irrigation was considered, soil texture and drainage and growing season temperature were the most important factors.

% Input Data Layers
% Input data sources were used to characterize ownership, climate, soils, terrain, and water.
% Permanently Non-Suitable Mask Permanently non-suitable land removed from the analysis included all Federal ownership, developed land, water, slopes greater than 15%, and soil salinity greater than 4 deciSiemens per meter.
% Normalizing Functions
% Functions were developed from the literature and survey results to convert input data to normalized values between 0 (least suitable) and 1 (most suitable). An alternative with irrigation ignores precipitation and adjusts water table depth and drainage functions.
% Precipitation Average monthly precipitation (in) from April to September. Monthly normalized scores are averaged.

% 0 – 20 inches Too shallow 20 – 40 inches Marginal shallow >= 40 inches Ideal
% Water Table Depth Depth (in) to water table. Function remains at 1 after 40 inches with irrigation.
% Suitability Ranges
% 0 – 20 inches Too shallow 20 – 40 inches Marginal shallow 40 – 100 inches Ideal >= 100 inches Marginal deep
% Slope Percent slope for land less than 15%.
% Suitability Ranges
% 0 – 10% Ideal 10 – 15% Marginal steep
% Soil Texture and Drainage Soil texture was classified from percent sand, silt, and clay. Drainage class was provided in the soil data.
% For the Excessively Drained and Somewhat Excessively Drained categories below, values assume no irrigation, and values in parentheses assume irrigation.
% Weights Variables were first compared to each other and assigned values from 1 to 9 representing “equal” importance to “extreme more” importance. The matrix of pairwise comparisons was then converted to a single column vector of weights.
% Final Calculation/Suitability Classification An overall suitability score for each cell was calculated by multiplying each normalized raster by its factor weight, then summing the resulting rasters. Suitability classes were defined as Highly Suitable (0.8 – 1), Moderately Suitable (0.6 - 0.8), Marginally Suitable (0.4 - 0.6), and Currently Not Suitable (0 - 0.4).

% Conclusions
% • The "Irrigation" scenario reweights the factors without precipitation and adjusts the soil depth and soil texture and drainage class normalization functions. It does not consider whether irrigation is possible or practical.
% • Growing season precipitation is the most important factor when irrigation is not considered.
% • Growing season temperature and soil texture and drainage class are the most important factors with irrigation.
% • Using pairwise importance weights with the analytic hierarchy process increases the contribution of precipitation to overall suitability from .11 to .33 under the “Rainfall” scenario, and reduces “highly suitable” acres from 7,914,299 to 396,242.
% • With "Irrigation" and equally weighted factors, growing season length and slope had a larger influence on suitability.
% • Next steps:
% • Improve categorization of suitable areas by using improved higher resolution land classification data.
% • Integrate suitable areas with parcel data to identify owners of properties with adequate size and land use for extension outreach efforts and to eliminate unsuitable properties from further economic and optimization modeling.

\subsection{Climate Change}
\label{sec:climate}

In order to asses
One climate change scenarios was tested, A1B. 
%
The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very
rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and
declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more
efficient technologies. A1B predicts a balanced utiliziation of
avilable energy sources, defined as not relying too heavily on one
particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement
rates apply to all energy supply and end-use technologies~\cite{}.
%
This represents a commonly used \ac{IPCC} climate change scenario.
Estimations of the expected change in climate came from the IPCC
ensemble estimations~\cite{ipcc-ensemble}.  These estimations are an
amalgamation of 32 different climate change scenarios.  The ensemble
predictions are available at 0.5 minute grid cells.  Estimations of
change in the next fifty years were used in these climate change
estimations.

The \ac{IPCC} estimations cannot be used directly, especially
comparatively to the current estimations using the \ac{PRISM}
data.  This is because when comparing the \ac{IPCC}'s somewhat coarse
scale estimations, to the more detailed \ac{PRISM} estimations the
current (2000-2014) predictions exhibit bias in their estimations.
Therefore, the \ac{IPCC} estimations were used to determine the
predicted change in temperature and precipitation for the \ac {AHB}
region, and these changes were then applied to the current \ac{PRISM}
estimations. For example, the 50 year change in temperature, and
precipitation for the A1B \ac{IPCC} scenario shows a mean
increase in temperature of about ? degrees Celsius, with larger
changes in the foo and the bar.  Mean annual precipitation throughout
the region stays relatively constant, but shows modifications in both
location, and timing of the precipitation do undergo
changes~(Figure~\ref{fig:change}).

  \caption{Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation under \ac{IPCC} sceanario A1B for plantation planted in 2040.}
  \label{fig:change}
\end{figure}

In total, the three \ac{IPCC} scenarios were compared at three
distinct initial planting dates; 2020, 2040 and 2060, and under the
same set of 8 different \ac{3pg} poplar parameterizations, for a total
of 79 estimations per pixel in the \ac{AHB} region.

The mean change in yields are not necessarily a good estimation of
local estimations of changes in yield predictions.  Regional changes
in temperature and precipitation induce considerable heterogeneity in
the yield change estimations.  Looking again, at \ac{IPCC} scenario
A1B, for the 2040-2058 time frame, we see considerable -- blah
blah blah -.  These patterns are somewhat similar to all \ac{IPCC}
scenarios, becoming more pronounced as the estimation is moved into
the future~(Figure~\ref{fig:new-change}.

Such estimations can inform both the individual farmer in terms of
predicting long term viability of Poplar plantations as a \ac{SRWC}
feedstock, as well as regional estimations on the mid-term ability of
such a feedstock to provide an expected harvest, and therefore an
expected level of biofuel production.  Not only changes in expected
overall yields, but changes in the spatial distribution of the yields
can have impacts on economic analysis of a \ac{SRWC} based biofuel
industry in the \ac{PNW}.  

Next Steps 

For irrigated land, Current yields are input into a \ac{BCAM} model
where they compete with existing crops to determine there economic
viability.  It's hard to add water into the system as a direct cost of
operation, because it's a confusing mush of real costs; availability
and rights.  One way to address this issue is to include water as a
zero-sum game in the adoption model.

For non-irrigated land, marginal and under utilized lands can be
added into the overall agricultural economy as newly minted lands.
These may compete with other agriculture crops, but they can also

Yields provide viability
Yields help farmers make decisions

TODO
- Look at more localized estimations
- Compare mean estimations to changes in yield based on actual more changing weather patterns
- - IN that same context, look at different time frames for your estimations. 
- - These can provide some larger error bounds on our
