abstract = {The fourth version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) was recently completed and released to the climate community. This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and documents fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 18 results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.48-resolution CCSM3. Two changes to the deep convection scheme in the atmosphere component result in CCSM4 producing El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation variability with a much more realistic frequency distribution than in CCSM3, although the amplitude is too large compared to observations. These changes also improve the Madden–Julian oscillation and the frequency distribution of tropical precipitation. A new overflow parameterization in the ocean component leads to an improved simulation of the Gulf Stream path and the North Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation. Changes to the CCSM4 land component lead to a much improved annual cycle of water storage, especially in the tropics. The CCSM4 sea ice component uses much more realistic albedos than CCSM3, and for several reasons the Arctic sea ice concentration is improved in CCSM4. An ensemble of twentieth-century simulations produces a good match to the observed September Arctic sea ice extent from 1979 to 2005. The CCSM4 ensemble mean increase in globally averaged surface temperature between 1850 and 2005 is larger than the observed increase by about 0.48C. This is consistent with the fact that CCSM4 does not include a representation of the indirect effects of aerosols, although other factors may come into play. The CCSM4 still has significant biases, such as the mean precipitation distribution in the tropical Pacific Ocean, too much low cloud in the Arctic, and the latitudinal distributions of shortwave and longwave cloud forcings.},

abstract = {Establishing short-rotation tree plantations for bioenergy and fiber production on agricultural land (abandoned farmland) would provide significant environmental and economic benefits for rural communities and society as a whole. Walker hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x P. nigra) is one of the most commonly used varieties cultivated in Saskatchewan, Canada; however, there are no existing hybrid poplar growth models in the literature. The aim of this work was to parameterize and evaluate the 3PG model (Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth) to predict Walker tree growth in the climate and soils of Saskatchewan. We used annual data from Walker poplar trials (4- to 11-yr old stands) established at three spacing levels (2.4, 3.0, and 3.7 m) at three sites located in central Saskatchewan, Hnr, BH, and ML sites. The data were split into two sets – the modeling set from the Hnr site was used to parameterize 3PG, and the testing sets from the BH and ML sites were used to evaluate Walker growth predictions made by 3PG. The bias, sum(predicted minus observed) divided by number of observations, for tree height predictions ranged from −1.76 to 1.45 m, and bias for diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from −2.61 to 0.66 cm. Regression R-square values of 3PG-predicted versus observed height and DBH ranged from 0.75 to 0.98. Our results indicated that, once parameterized, 3PG could predict Walker hybrid poplar growth with desirable accuracy by only utilizing commonly available soils and climate data for marginal or more productive agricultural land across Saskatchewan.},

@article{Hinckley1994,
abstract = {We studied water flux in a four-year-old stand of hybrid Populus during midsummer 1992. Study trees ranged in height from 11.0 to 15.1 m and in diameter from 8.3 to 15.1 cm. The large-leafed Populus hybrid was relatively poorly coupled to the atmosphere. The average value of the stomatal decoupling coefficient, \{Omega\}, was 0.66, indicating that, on average, a 10\% change in stomatal conductance would result in only a 3 to 4\% change in transpiration. During the middle of the summer, the smallest study tree used between 20 and 26 kg of water per day, whereas the largest tree used between 39 and 51 kg day-1. The maximum observed rate of stand water loss was 4.8 mm day-1 in this Populus clone. Maximum rates of sap velocity within the xylem were as high as 12.5 m h-1; measured rates for exposed sunlit branches approached 90\% of this maximum. Within-canopy patterns of stomatal conductance generally reflected patterns of incident radiation. Stomatal conductance of foliage grown in shade, even when exposed to non-limiting light and water source conditions, did not increase appreciably. Patterns of stomatal conductance under limiting and non-limiting conditions suggested that both stomatal conductance and leaf specific hydraulic conductivity (LSHC) were linked with the ability to exploit the light resource.},

abstract = {In this paper an application of the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to asset valuation is presented. It has two purposes: solving some of the drawbacks found in classical asset valuation methods and broadening the scope of current approaches. The ANP is a method based on Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) that accurately models complex environments. This approach is particularly useful in problems which work with partially available data, qualitative variables and influences among the variables, which are very common situations in the valuation context. As an illustration, the new approach has been applied to a real case study of an industrial park located in Valencia (Spain) using three different models. The results confirm the validity of the methodology and show that the more information is incorporated into the model, the more accurate the solution will be, so the presented methodology stands out as a good alternative to current valuation approaches.},

@article{Landsberg1997,
abstract = {This paper describes a stand growth model, based on physiological processes, which incorporates a number of steps and procedures that have allowed considerable simplification relative to extant process-based models. The model, called 3-PG (use of Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth), calculates total carbon fixed (gross primary production; PG) from utilizable, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation ($\phi$p.a.u.), obtained by correcting the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the forest canopy ($\phi$p.a.) for the effects of soil drought, atmospheric vapour pressure deficits and stand age. PG is obtained from $\phi$p.a.u. and the canopy quantum efficiency, values of which are becoming available. The ratio of net (PN) to gross primary production is emerging as relatively constant for trees. This eliminates the need to calculate respiration and is used to estimate PN—the net amount of carbon converted to biomass. 3-PG uses a simple relationship to estimate the amount of carbon allocated below ground and a procedure based on allometric ratios—widely available for many species and situations—to determine the allocation of carbon to foliage and stems and constrain tree growth patterns. The effects of nutrition are incorporated through the carbon allocation procedure; the amount of carbon allocated below ground will increase with decreasing soil fertility. Recently acquired knowledge about the physiological factors causing decline in forest growth rates with age is used to model that decline. Changes in stem populations (self-thinning) are derived from a procedure based on the −32 power law, combined with stem growth rates. The model requires weather data as input, works on monthly time steps and has been run for periods up to 120 years, producing realistic patterns of stem growth and stem diameter increments. The time course of leaf area index is realistic for a range of soil conditions and atmospheric constraints. 3-PG can be run from remotely-sensed estimates of leaf area index coupled to weather data and basic, readily available information about soils and stand characteristics. It is being tested as a practical tool against forestry data from New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand. Test results show excellent correspondence between stand growth measurements and simulated stem growth over 30 years.},

abstract = {Short rotation coppice culture systems are characterized by a high stool and shoot density, and by rotation durations between 2 and 3 years for species showing an extremely fast growth such as poplar. With the objective to study the long-term biomass production evolution and dynamic of such systems, a high-density plantation with 17 poplar (Populus) clones belonging to six parentages was established in April 1996 and coppiced in December 1996, January 2001, and February 2004. At the end of each growing season, stool survival, shoot diameter, and the number of shoots per stool were measured. Biomass production was estimated directly by harvesting a number of shoots or indirectly via allometric power equations. Stool survival rates differed among parentages and from year to year irrespective of number of rotations; the highest rates were for P. nigra and the lowest rates were for P. deltoides × P. nigra and P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa parentages. In the second and third rotations, the P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrids showed very high mortality rates. The number of shoots per stool varied among rotations and parentages, and shoot elimination was parentage specific. The number of shoots per stool increased with increasing rotation number, while they decreased from year to year within each rotation. A single general allometric equation linking shoot diameter to shoot biomass could be used to estimate biomass production for most years and most clones. Exceptions were found for the year 2001 and for clone Hazendans. Biomass production differed among parentages and among rotations. The different parentages also differed in their strategy of biomass accumulation. Although P. nigra had the highest biomass production over 11 years, the parentage ranking of biomass production shifted over rotations. The P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrids showed high biomass production in the first rotation, but low in the second and third rotations. Biomass production increased from year to year within one rotation, while it decreased with rotation number. Among the parentages examined, P. nigra and P. trichocarpa were the best performing ones and the best adapted to the multiple coppice rotations.},

abstract = {Validation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from moderate resolution remote sensing observations generally involves optical technique to measure ground LAI. As the current validation datasets are derived using multiple optical retrieval techniques, assessment of the consistency between these techniques is required. In this study the effective Plant Area Index (PAIeff) retrievals by three major optical instruments, LAI-2000, AccuPAR, and Digital Hemispherical Photographs (DHPs), were analyzed over 10 crops (soybean, corn, alfalfa, sorghum, peanut and pasture) at Manfredi site in Cordoba province, Argentina. The focus of research was on quantifying PAIeff sensitivity to the type of instrument, retrieval parameters and gap fraction inversion methods as well as environmental conditions (canopy heterogeneity, senescent vegetation, illumination conditions). Results indicate that sensitivity of DHP method to illumination conditions is low (14\% compared to 28\% and 86\% for LAI-2000 and AccuPAR, respectively). The intercomparison of PAIeff retrievals indicates large discrepancies between optical techniques for short canopy over which downward-pointing DHP technique performs better than LAI-2000 and AccuPAR. Better agreement was found for tall canopy without senescent vegetation and low spatial heterogeneity. Overall, discrepancies in PAIeff between instruments are mainly explained by differences in spatial sampling of transmittance between instruments (over short and heterogeneous canopies) caused by variations in instrument footprint, azimuthal range, and zenith angle spatial resolution (coarser for LAI-2000 than DHP). Our results indicate that DHP is the most robust technique in terms of low sensitivity to illumination conditions, accurate spatial sampling of transmittance, ability to capture gap fraction over short canopy using downward-looking photographs, independence from canopy optical ancillary information, and potential to derive clumping index. It can thus be applied to a large range of canopy structures, and environmental conditions as required by validation protocols. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {According to the great mathematician Henri Lebesgue, making direct comparisons of objects with regard to a property is a fundamental mathematical process for deriving measurements. Measuring objects by using a known scale first then comparing the measurements works well for properties for which scales of measurement exist. The theme of this paper is that direct comparisons are necessary to establish measurements for intangible properties that have no scales of measurement. In that case the value derived for each element depends on what other elements it is compared with. We showhowrelative scales can be derived by making pairwise comparisons using numerical judgments from an absolute scale of numbers. Such measurements, when used to represent comparisons can be related and combined to define a cardinal scale of absolute numbers that is stronger than a ratio scale. They are necessary to use when intangible factors need to be added and multiplied among themselves and with tangible factors. To derive and synthesize relative scales systematically, the factors are arranged in a hierarchic or a network structure and measured according to the criteria represented within these structures. The process of making comparisons to derive scales of measurement is illustrated in two types of practical real life decisions, the Iran nuclear show-down with the West in this decade and building a Disney park in Hong Kong in 2005. It is then generalized to the case of making a continuum of comparisons by using Fredholm’s equation of the second kind whose solution gives rise to a functional equation. The Fourier transform of the solution of this equation in the complex domain is a sum of Dirac distributions demonstrating that proportionate response to stimuli is a process of firing and synthesis of firings as neurons in the brain do. The Fourier transform of the solution of the equation in the real domain leads to nearly inverse square responses to natural influences. Various generalizations and critiques of the approach are included. Presentado},

abstract = {Hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) is an important biomass crop being evaluated for cellulosic ethanol production. Predictions of poplar growth, rotation period, and soil carbon sequestration under various growing conditions, soils, and climates are critical for farmers and managers planning to establish short-rotation forestry (SRF) plantations. In this study, we used an ecoinformatics workflow, the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn), to integrate literature data and field measurements into the Ecosystem Demography 2 (ED2) model to estimate yield potential of poplar plantations. Within PEcAn 164 records of seven different traits from the literature were assimilated using a Bayesian meta-analysis. Next, variance decomposition identified seven variables for further constraint that contributed > 80\% to the uncertainty in modeled yields: growth respiration, dark respiration, quantum efficiency, mortality coefficient, water conductance, fine-root allocation, and root turnover rate. Assimilation of observed yields further constrained uncertainty in model parameters (especially dark respiration and root turnover rate) and biomass estimates. Additional measurements of growth respiration, mortality, water conductance, and quantum efficiency would provide the most efficient path toward further constraint of modeled yields. Modeled validation demonstrated that ED2 successfully captured the interannual and spatial variability of poplar yield observed at nine independent sites. Site-level analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of land use change to SRF poplar on soil C sequestration compared to alternate land uses. These suggest that poplar plantations became a C sink within 18 years of conversion from corn production or existing forest. Finally, poplar yields were estimated for the contiguous United States at a half degree resolution in order to determine potential productivity, estimate the optimal rotation period, and compare poplar to perennial grass yields. This regional projection suggests that poplar yield varies considerably with differences in soil and climate, reaching as much as 18 Mg x ha(-1) x yr(-1) in eastern, southern, and northwest regions. In New England, the upper Midwest, and northern California, yields are predicted to exceed those of the highly productive C4 perennial grass, Miscanthus. In these poplar-productive regions, 4-11 year rotations give the highest potential yields. In conclusion, poplar plantations are predicted to have a high yield potential across a wide range of climates and soils and could be sustainable in soil C sequestration.},

abstract = {Purpose-grown trees will be part of the bioenergy solution in the United States, especially in the Southeast where plantation forestry is prevalent and economically important. Trees provide a "living biomass inventory" with existing end-use markets and associated infrastructure, unlike other biomass species such as perennial grasses. The economic feasibility of utilizing tree biomass is improved by increasing productivity through alternative silvicultural systems, improved breeding and biotechnology. Traditional breeding and selection, as well as the introduction of genes for improved growth and stress tolerance, have enabled high growth rates and improved site adaptability in trees grown for industrial applications. An example is the biotechnology-aided improvement of a highly productive tropical Eucalyptus hybrid, Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla. This tree has acquired freeze tolerance by the introduction of a plant transcription factor that up-regulates the cold-response pathways and makes possible commercial plantings in the Southeastern United States. Transgenic trees with reduced lignin, modified lignin, or increased cellulose and hemicellulose will improve the efficiency of feedstock conversion into biofuels. Reduced lignin trees have been shown to improve efficiency in the pre-treatment step utilized in fermentation systems for biofuels production from lignocellulosics. For systems in which thermochemical or gasification approaches are utilized, increased density will be an important trait, while increased lignin might be a desired trait for direct firing or co-firing of wood for energy. Trees developed through biotechnology, like all transgenic plants, need to go through the regulatory process, which involves biosafety and risk assessment analyses prior to commercialization.},

abstract = {Chronic exposure of hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides x trichocarpa) plants to low concentrations of ozone had negative impact upon net photosynthetic capacity, dark respiration, and leaf chlorophyll contents. Exposure to as much as 0.20 microliters per liter O(3) had no immediate effect on net photosynthesis (P(n)), but chronic exposure to 0.125 or 0.085 microliters per liter had a number of gradual effects on CO(2) exchange. These included increased dark respiration and consequently increased light compensation points in very young leaves (4-6 days old); and decreased P(n), leaf chlorophyll a and b contents, light saturation points, and apparent quantum yields in leaves 10 to 70 days old. Decreased P(n) was partially due to accelerated aging in leaves exposed to O(3), and lightsaturated P(n) was linearly related to chlorophyll a + b contents. Differences in light-saturated P(n) between control and O(3)-treated leaves of the same age were mostly due to photosaturation in O(3)-treated leaves and to a much lesser extent to lowered apparent quantum yields. Also, since P(n) and dark respiration were most affected by O(3) at different leaf ages, distinct modes of action are suggested. The effects of leaf aging on CO(2) exchange were considerable, but typical of other species. However, careful monitoring of the interacting effects of leaf age and pollutant exposure was needed in order to characterize the impact of chronic O(3) exposure upon CO(2) exchange.},

Despite interest in this approach, little attention has been paid to the best metrics for assessing the growth performance of grafted plants over time. Based on an analysis of the grafting literature and our own data, we show that the choice of metrics to assess tree growth can entirely change the conclusions reached about the relative importance of age versus size. We recommend that absolute as well as relative rates of growth are calculated and that scion size be standardized as much as possible at the start of the experiment. Once proper metrics are chosen, all of the available published evidence is largely concordant with two concepts: (1) age-mediated controls of tree growth are likely to be important during the first few years of a tree's life (before phase change); and (2) after the first few years of a tree's life, size-mediated factors largely prevail over age-mediated factors in determining tree growth rates. We found no support for theories invoking age-mediated sink limitations in old trees.},

We compared LAI estimates of 56 fisheye photos strategically placed in the orchard to validate 500,000 MLB point scans of a small portion of the aisles between tree rows to water and vegetation indexes of MASTER (MODIS/ASTER simulator) and Landsat 5 imagery. The high correlation of fisheye photo LAI to MLB LAI estimates establishes this new method against the measurement standard within the plant community while significantly increasing sample size. MLB LAI and MASTER vegetation indexes, such as NDWI (normalized difference water index), GMI (Gitelson-Merzlyak index) and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), were highly correlated (r 2=0.90). In addition, a high correlation (r 2=0.80) between the MLB measured LAI and selected Landsat derived vegetation indexes (VI) was found. This scaling and validation of LAI estimate expands the spatial area and frequency of determination for time series analysis of crop phenology studies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) has recently been developed and released to the climate community. CCSM3 is a coupled climate model with components representing the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic simulations over a wide range of spatial resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations lasting several millennia or detailed studies of continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate change. This paper will show results from the configuration used for climate-change simulations with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a grid with approximately 1 degrees resolution for the ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates several significant improvements in the physical parameterizations. The enhancements in the model physics are designed to reduce or eliminate several systematic biases in the mean climate produced by previous editions of CCSM. These include new treatments of cloud processes, aerosol radiative forcing, land-atmosphere fluxes, ocean mixed layer processes, and sea ice dynamics. There are significant improvements in the sea ice thickness, polar radiation budgets, tropical sea surface temperatures, and cloud radiative effects. CCSM3 can produce stable climate simulations of millennial duration without ad hoc adjustments to the fluxes exchanged among the component models. Nonetheless, there are still systematic biases in the ocean-atmosphere fluxes in coastal regions west of continents, the spectrum of ENSO variability, the spatial distribution of precipitation in the tropical oceans, and continental precipitation and surface air temperatures. Work is under way to extend CCSM to a more accurate and comprehensive model of the earth's climate system.},

We consider the implications of this relationship to the water relations of trees. We have compiled quantitative data on the water relations, hydraulic architecture and vulnerability of embolism of four widely different species: Rhizophora mangle, Cassipourea elliptica, Acer saccharum, and Thuja occidentalis. Using these data, we modeled the dynamics of water flow and xylem blockage for these species. The model is specifically focused on the conditions required to generate ;runaway embolism,' whereby the blockage of xylem conduits through embolism leads to reduced hydraulic conductance causing increased tension in the remaining vessels and generating more tension in a vicious circle. The model predicted that all species operate near the point of catastrophic xylem failure due to dynamic water stress. The model supports Zimmermann's plant segmentation hypothesis. Zimmermann suggested that plants are designed hydraulically to sacrifice highly vulnerable minor branches and thus improve the water balance of remaining parts. The model results are discussed in terms of the morphology, hydraulic architecture, eco-physiology, and evolution of woody plants.},

abstract = {Trees need to store reserves to allow their survival during winter and for bud flush and leaf growth in the following spring. In many tree species, these reserve functions are mainly covered by starch, which is degraded to soluble carbohydrates during the dormant season for maintenance respiration and in spring during bud flush. We conducted girdling experiments on poplar (Populus deltoides x nigra cv. Dorskamp) in order to elucidate how interrupted transport of carbohydrates to the roots during autumn affects plant survival during winter and bud flush in spring. We measured the content of starch, sucrose, glucose, fructose, raffinose and stachyose in stems (above and below the girdle), coarse roots and fine roots over 1 year. We found that, in response to girdling, carbohydrates accumulated in stems above the girdle. As a result of interrupted reserve allocation, girdled plants depleted their root starch reserves nearly to zero, whereas in stems below the girdle, reserves were maintained close to control values, presumably in order to facilitate dormancy release and re-sprouting from buds below the girdle. Furthermore, we showed that stachyose accumulated during winter also in the roots, even in girdled plants, consistent with its importance as freezing protectant. The lower stachyose content of roots compared with shoots was likely due to protection of the roots from cold by the soil.},

Spatial information including feedstock resources, existing and potential refinery locations and a transportation network model is provided to a mixed integer-linear optimization model that determines the optimal locations, technology types and sizes of biorefineries to satisfy a maximum profit objective function applied across the biofuel supply and demand chain from site of feedstock production to the product fuel terminal. The resource basis includes preliminary considerations of crop and residue sustainability. Sensitivity analyses explore possible effects of policy and technology changes. At a target market price of 19.6 \$ GJ−1, the model predicts a feasible production level of 610–1098 PJ, enough to supply up to 15\% of current regional liquid transportation fuel demand.},

abstract = {Bioenergy has been recognized as an important source of energy that will reduce nation’s dependency on petroleum, and have a positive impact on the economy, environment, and society. Production of bioenergy is expected to increase. As a result, we foresee an increase in the number of biorefineries in the near future. This paper analyzes logistical challenges with supplying biomass to a biorefinery. We also propose a mathematical model that can be used to design the supply chain and manage the logistics of a biorefinery. Supply chain-design decisions are long-term type of decisions; while logistics management involves medium to short-term decisions. The proposed model coordinates these decisions. The model determines the number, size and location of biorefineries needed to produce biofuel using the available biomass. The model also determines the amount of biomass shipped, processed and inventoried during a time period. Inputs to the model are the availability of biomass feedstock, as well as biomass transportation, inventory and processing costs. We use the State of Mississippi as the testing ground of this model.},

@article{Kim2008,
abstract = {We examined the tradeoffs between stand-level water use and carbon uptake that result when biomass production of trees in plantations is maximized by removing nutrient and water limitations. A Populus trichocarpa Torr. x P. deltoides Bartr. \& Marsh. plantation was irrigated and received frequent additions of nutrients to optimize biomass production. Sap flux density was measured continuously over four of the six growing-season months, supplemented with periodic measurements of leaf gas exchange and water potential. Measurements of tree diameter and height were used to estimate leaf area and biomass production based on allometric relationships. Sap flux was converted to canopy conductance and analyzed with an empirical model to isolate the effects of water limitation. Actual and soil-water-unlimited potential CO(2) uptakes were estimated with a canopy conductance constrained carbon assimilation (4C-A) scheme, which couples actual or potential canopy conductance with vertical gradients of light distribution, leaf-level conductance, maximum Rubisco capacity and maximum electron transport. Net primary production (NPP) was about 43\% of gross primary production (GPP); when estimated for individual trees, this ratio was independent of tree size. Based on the NPP/GPP ratio, we found that current irrigation reduced growth by about 18\% compared with growth with no water limitation. To achieve maximum growth, however, would require 70\% more water for transpiration, and would reduce water-use efficiency by 27\%, from 1.57 to 1.15 g stem wood C kg(-1) water. Given the economic and social values of water, plantation managers appear to have optimized water use.},

abstract = {The importance of characterizing, quantifying, and monitoring land cover, land use, and their changes has been widely recognized by global and environmental change studies. Since the early 1990s, three U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products (circa 1992, 2001, and 2006) have been released as free downloads for users. The NLCD 2006 also provides land cover change products between 2001 and 2006. To continue providing updated national land cover and change datasets, a new initiative in developing NLCD 2011 is currently underway. We present a new Comprehensive Change Detection Method (CCDM) designed as a key component for the development of NLCD 2011 and the research results from two exemplar studies. The CCDM integrates spectral-based change detection algorithms including a Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) model and a novel change model called Zone, which extracts change information from two Landsat image pairs. The MIICA model is the core module of the change detection strategy and uses four spectral indices (CV, RCVMAX, dNBR, and dNDVI) to obtain the changes that occurred between two image dates. The CCDM also includes a knowledge-based system, which uses critical information on historical and current land cover conditions and trends and the likelihood of land cover change, to combine the changes from MIICA and Zone. For NLCD 2011, the improved and enhanced change products obtained from the CCDM provide critical information on location, magnitude, and direction of potential change areas and serve as a basis for further characterizing land cover changes for the nation. An accuracy assessment from the two study areas show 100\% agreement between CCDM mapped no-change class with reference dataset, and 18\% and 82\% disagreement for the change class for WRS path/row p22r39 and p33r33, respectively. The strength of the CCDM is that the method is simple, easy to operate, widely applicable, and capable of capturing a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances potentially associated with land cover changes on different landscapes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Quantum efficiency, dark respiration and light compensation point were generally not affected by the shade treatments. Quantum efficiency, dark respiration, maximum photosynthesis and light compensation point did not change consistently between the first and second growing seasons.

abstract = {The control of the quality of irradiation data is often a prerequisite to their further processing. Though data are usually controlled by meteorological offices, the sources are so numerous that the user often faces time-series of measurements containing questionable values. As customers of irradiation data, we established our own procedures to screen time-series of measurements. Since this problem of quality control is of concern to many researchers and engineers and since it is often a lengthy and tedious task, we decided to make this screening procedure available to everyone as a web service. This service is the purpose of this paper. The objective is not to perform a precise and fine control, an objective out of reach without details on the site and instruments, but to perform a likelihood control of the data and to check their plausibility. This is achieved by comparing observations with some expectations based upon the extraterrestrial irradiation and a simulation of the irradiation for clear skies. This service is available to everyone on the Web site www.helioclim.net. It offers a very convenient means to check time-series of irradiation: Data are input in a HTML page by a copy and paste procedure and the return is also a HTML page that can be analyzed in detail for the data flagged as suspicious. © Elsevier Science Ltd.

Altogether, 26 papers and publications have been prepared under this project, discussing a large number of coppicing mechanisms and factors of many important short-rotation hardwood tree species, the main emphasis being on birch, poplar, alder and willow. Coppicing research is reviewed briefly on the basis of two inquiries. There were 20 research projects and a total of 39 researchers dealing with coppicing in the various participating countries. A survey of coppicing problems indicates a need for scientific projects in ecophysiology, anatomy and stand dynamics.},

abstract = {Ten-day evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficient (k(c)) of willow and poplar SRC used as vegetation filter and grown under fertilised (F) and unfertilised (NF) conditions, were determined for two successive growing seasons using volumetric lysimeters. During the first growing season, total ETc observed was, respectively, 620 (NF)-1190 (F)mm in willow and 590 (NF)-725 (F) in poplar. During the second growing season, ETc showed a general increase, mainly in fertilised lysimeters where it ranged between 890 (NF)-1790 mm (F) in willow and 710 (NF)-1100 mm (NF) in poplar. kc reached in both years its maximum between the end of August and the beginning of September. In 2004 maximum kc ranged from 1.25-2.84 in willow and 1.06-1.90 in poplar, whereas in 2005 it ranged from 1.97-5.30 in willow and 1.71-4.28 in poplar. ETc seemed to be strongly correlated to plant development and mainly dependent on its nutritional status rather than on the differences between the species.},

Poplar growth was strongly reduced on sandy soils (). Irrigation increased yield on all soil types by 25\% while fertilization increased yield by 26\%. The highest yield was simulated for the combined irrigation/fertilization (). Length of rotation cycle greatly influenced yield; optimal rotation cycle in terms of yield was 3 or 4 years. The results clearly indicate a useful role for process models in predicting effects of management strategies on poplar yield in short rotation coppice.},

Five poplar clones were grown under an intensively cultured regime at two different locations, Afsnee (near Gent, Belgium) and Orsay (near Paris, France). Leaf area was related linearly or non-linearly (power or logarithmic functions) to parameters that can be measured easily and non-destructively, such as leaf length or width, stem or branch diameter, stem or tree height, and volume index. Only small differences in the basic allometric relationships were noticed between the two sites and the five clones. A very good agreement was observed between leaf area index (LAI) values estimated from allometric relations and from indirect measurements using a plant canopy analyzer. These observations suggest that simple and general relations can be used to estimate LAI in young, high density poplar stands or leaf area at different organizational levels in trees.},
