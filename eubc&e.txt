Quinn Hart is a reasearcher with interests in agricultural modeling,
databases and geographic information.  This particular modeling work
was supported by the Advanced Hardwood Biofuels Northwest (AHB)
project.

Abstract: 

Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability of
a biofuels industry based on this feedstock requires spatial
predictions of the growth and yield of short rotation woody crops
(SRWC) under various environmental conditions and throughout large
regions.  The Physiological Principles in Predicting Growth (3-PG)
model was modified for SRWC, particularly for poplar plantation
methodologies.  This included developing a sub-model which takes into
account the coppicing strategy for harvesting poplar, that allows a
monthly growth contribution from an existing root mass.

The parameterized model was then applied to the entire Pacific
Northwest of the United States, using appropriate climatological and
soil input data.
