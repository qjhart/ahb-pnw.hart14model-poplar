- [x] L 20 either 8 million square kilometres or 8 000 000 km2 but never with the double multiplier form that you have on L20.

- [x] L 136 The order of tables and figures listed in the text is important and is supposed to be an ordinal set. L 136 introduces figure 6 before any of the sequence 1 - 5. This will slow down the production of your paper at the copy writing stage. You need to make figure 6 into figure 1, and renumber the remainder,
_Fixed by referring to the appropriate section instead of the figure_

- [x] L 141 JBB does not use footnotes, and a url is not a sufficient reference - see the Philson guide (cited below).
- [x] L 220 whatever does "content" mean. It is unscientific to give a fraction expresses as a %  without stating what it is e.g. mass fraction of ??? the dry material?
_I changed to 'comprise as 20% of gross weight_

- [x] Many spelling mistakes Intergevernmental? Table 4., maximum ran or rain?
_Spell-checked all `.tex` files_

- [x] L 396 differential temperatures in the SI unit system are always in Kelvin e.g. 1 K.
_changed 1 degree c to 274.15 degree K_

- [x] L 402 units immediately follow the value so 19.7 Mg ha-1 with no brackets. Also this journal does not use the slash divisor, so please use superscripts.
_changed all slash notation to exponential_

- [x] The Journal references need to follow the format as follows:
All journal citations follow this form - there is no punctuation in the surname initial, 
_No punctuation is used in surnames unless it it the last in the list of authors. Vancouver style places a period after the last author_

- [x] the journal name is the ISI/ISO abbreviation followed by the year; 
_updated all journal references to abbreviated style_

- [x] volume(issue):page start - page last with the last page carrying the most significant digits as the minimum needed for precision. 
_This seems to be the case for all already_

- [x] Note if there are more than 6 authors, retain only the first 6 and theno use et al. 
_This seems to be the case for all already_

- [x] In the event there is no issue number, the solution is to place the month of issue after the year.
For journal abbreviations a useful source is:  http://journalseek.net , and or http://cassi.cas.org/search.jsp

- [X] Whatever is the unit mo in table 2? Since month is not a fixed quantity - it is not a unit in the SI - write it out in full and do not attach it as though it is an actual unit. E.g. Parameter Monthly root contribution R-delta avoids creating a non unit, just as you did in Table 3.
_Added monthly to root contribution to acronym definition._

- [x] The various internet references needs significant work - please review The Philson library staff excellent guide to the Vancouver system and it addresses how to best describe a web source.  The reference below is in the correct  format for a monograph on the web.
_Fixed internet references by using the `webpage` [bibtex type](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/contrib/vancouver?lang=en) from CTAN_
