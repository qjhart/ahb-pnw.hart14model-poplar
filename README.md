Predicting the economic viability and environmental sustainability of a biofuels industry based on this
feedstock requires spatial predictions of the growth and yield of SRWC under various environmental conditions
and throughout large regions.  The 3PG
model was modified for modeling SRWC, particularly for poplar
plantation methodologies.  This included developing a sub-model
which takes into account the coppicing strategy for harvesting
poplar that allows a monthly growth contribution from an existing
root mass.

The parameterized model was then applied to the entire Pacific
Northwest of the United States, using appropriate climatological and
soil input data.  Existing agricultural patterns were used to
estimate regional water availability for irrigation, and for
nonirrigated regions, land cover features including ownership,
slope , soil salinity and water table depth where used to limit
predictions to areas with a real potential to support a \ac{SRWC}
plantation.

Results can be integrated with other models that allow for
optimizing the crop selection and biorefinery site selection.
Important findings from the model include; validation of the
3pg model for coppiced SRWC plantings, estimates of
biomass feedstock yields under different irrigation patterns and
weather conditions, and annual estimates for feedstock availability
when combined with crop adoption scenarios.
